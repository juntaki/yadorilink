//! Scan-wide, cross-file bulk block ingestion for a reconciliation scan.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! A reconciliation scan hashes every file it finds changed and has to make
//! those blocks durable before the rows and changes describing them can
//! commit. Doing that per file is what the block store's own batching
//! cannot fix from the inside: `chunk_file` commits per block, and
//! `chunk_file_content_defined_with_callback`/`chunk_file_fixed_with_
//! callback` batch only *within one file*, so a folder of small files —
//! where every file is one block — turns every batch into a one-block
//! batch. That is not a hypothetical shape; it is the ordinary one for a
//! source tree, and it was measured: importing 10,000 50-byte files cost
//! 9,286 `dir_fsync_first_shard` calls (27.97s of the 117.5s import), where
//! the store's two-level `root/aa/bb` layout only ever needs ~256 — one per
//! distinct `aa` prefix. `dir_fsync_root` firing exactly 256 times in the
//! same run is the corroboration: the prefixes really are 256-way, and the
//! other 9,030 fsyncs bought nothing.
//!
//! So the batch has to be pooled at a level that can see across file
//! boundaries, which is the scan. This type is that pool: blocks are hashed
//! by [`yadorilink_local_storage::hash_file_blocks`] (which commits
//! nothing), staged here as they are produced regardless of which file they
//! came from, and flushed in one `put_prepared_batch` when either bound
//! below is reached.
//!
//! What the store does with such a batch is its own business, and the
//! answer changed underneath this type: blocks that share a batch now also
//! share one durability barrier and one index transaction, where they used
//! to be one fsynced file each. This pool is what lets a folder of tiny
//! files reach the store as batches wide enough for that to matter at all
//! — without it, every batch is one block from one file, and there is
//! nothing to amortize.
//!
//! # The invariant this type must not break
//!
//! **No `FileRecord` and no DAG `Change` may become authoritative before
//! every block it references is durable.** Staging is what makes that
//! violable — a staged block is not durable, and the record describing it
//! is sitting in the scan's `prepared` set looking exactly as ready to
//! commit as it ever did.
//!
//! This type deliberately owns only half of that invariant, and it is the
//! half it can actually enforce: [`flush`](ScanBlockStaging::flush) does
//! not return `Ok` until `put_prepared_batch` has. The other half — that a
//! flush covering every staged block happens *before* the first commit —
//! lives at the single point in `local_change.rs` that can see both the
//! walk and the commit loop, and is asserted there. Anything that moves
//! block staging closer to the commit, or the commit closer to the walk,
//! has to re-establish it; it is not enforced by the type system.
//!
//! Group block provenance is recorded here, per flush, rather than per file
//! by the caller, for the same reason: provenance is a claim that this
//! device holds these blocks for this group, and recording it for a block
//! still sitting in this buffer would make that claim before it is true.
