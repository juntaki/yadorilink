//! Directories as replicated entries.
//!
//! A directory on disk is one of two things. One a user (or any other
//! process) made is an explicit entry: it is authored like a file, with its
//! mode as its only metadata. One this device made only to hold replicated
//! descendants is structural: derived state, never authored. The
//! structural-origin ledger is the only thing that tells them apart --
//! nothing observable on disk can -- so every decision here reads it, and
//! a directory whose origin nobody can state is kept and authored as
//! nothing.
//!
//! Deleting a directory deletes the entries this device observed in it,
//! one point delete each: never a prefix, so an entry a peer created there
//! concurrently, or one indexed here but not yet written to disk, survives.
//! The deletes are authored as one signed recursive operation, cut into
//! parts, so the folder can later be restored as the unit it was removed
//! as. Renaming a directory is one operation the same way: each observed
//! explicit entry deleted at its old path and put at its new one. A
//! structural directory stays structural when renamed.
