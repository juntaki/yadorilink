/// into.
///
/// The error shape alone is NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT, and it is worth
/// being blunt about why, because the shape check reads like it ought to be
/// enough. `chunk_file`, `chunk_file_content_defined_with_callback`, and
/// `chunk_file_fixed_with_callback` (`yadorilink-local-storage`'s
/// `chunker.rs`) read the source file via a bare `?` on `fs::metadata`/
/// `fs::File::open`, so a source-path `NotFound` arrives here as
/// `Storage(Io(NotFound))`. But `StorageError::Io` is a blanket
/// `#[from] std::io::Error` over EVERY filesystem call the block store
/// itself makes, and the block store has its own real `NotFound` paths —
/// e.g. `SegmentBlockStore::commit_batch` runs its free-space preflight
/// (`check_headroom` -> `free_space::classify_volume`, which stats the
/// block-store root) BEFORE any `create_dir_all` could recreate anything,
/// so a block-store root that has been deleted or whose volume was
/// unmounted also surfaces as `Storage(Io(NotFound))`; so does a
/// concurrent removal racing `commit_block_staged`'s
/// `exists()`-then-`fs::read` of an already-present block file. The error
/// value carries no path, so the two fault domains are genuinely
/// indistinguishable from the error alone — which is exactly why
/// `is_retriable_block_store_error` above does not try.
///
/// Getting that wrong is not a cosmetic misclassification. A `true` verdict
/// makes the caller return `LocalChangeOutcome::None`, and `process_flush`
/// treats `None` as a clean no-op: it CLEARS the durable
/// `local_dirty_paths` journal row for this path. For a genuinely vanished
/// source path that is right (there is nothing left to index, and the
/// rename's own watcher event queues a fresh `CreatedOrModified` for the
/// final name — see `watcher.rs`'s `RenameMode::To`/`Both` handling). For a
/// block-store fault it is a silent, permanent loss of an already-detected
/// local edit: the file is still sitting on disk, changed, with nothing
/// left to re-drive it — the exact split-brain the retry/journal machinery
/// in `process_flush` exists to prevent.
///
/// So the verdict is taken from the PATH, not from the error: the
/// `NotFound` shape only gets us as far as "one of the two files involved
/// went missing", and the `symlink_metadata` re-stat below decides which
/// one. `symlink_metadata`, not `metadata`, so a dangling symlink — whose
/// target is missing but which is itself very much still there, and is
/// handled by `build_symlink_record`, not by chunking — is never misread as
/// a vanished path.
///
/// The re-stat can of course race in its turn, and both directions of that
/// race are safe. If `path` came back between the chunk attempt and this
/// stat (a write-then-rename that has already put a NEW file at the same
/// name), the stat succeeds, this returns `false`, and the error falls
/// through to `is_retriable_block_store_error`'s bounded retry — which
/// re-derives everything from a fresh lstat and indexes whatever is
/// actually there now. A stat that fails for any reason OTHER than
/// `NotFound` likewise returns `false` and falls through to the retry
/// path. Both are the conservative direction: the worst case is some
/// wasted retries, never a dropped edit.
///
/// FUTURE READER: do not "simplify" this back into a pure match on the
/// error shape. That form looks equivalent, compiles, passes the
/// happy-path rename test, and silently drops local edits whenever the
/// block store is the thing that is missing. See
/// `a_block_store_not_found_while_the_source_file_still_exists_stays_dirty`

        // suppress-next-event flag, an ignore table, etc.).
        //
        // Deliberately gated on the TARGET matching, not merely on an intent
        // being open at all: presence alone would just as happily suppress a
        // genuine local edit racing a DIFFERENT target. Worked example this

        // the watcher's event lands while the intent for A is still open.

        // does not fire, and B falls through to the ordinary comparison
        // below, which correctly sees B diverge from the indexed content and
        // captures it as a real edit. Only an event whose on-disk content
        // hashes to EXACTLY the target a live intent for this path is
        // projecting is treated as that projection's own echo.

        // CONTENT MATCHING THE INTENT IS NOT, BY ITSELF, PROOF THIS IS AN
        // ECHO -- the same lesson the exec-bit/xattr check just below this

        // comparison applies here too, for an identical reason. A real
        // metadata-only edit (chmod, an xattr change) can land on a path

        // human edit racing the still-open intent, haven't run yet) --
