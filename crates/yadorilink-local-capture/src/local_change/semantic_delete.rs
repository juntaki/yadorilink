//! A user's delete of the LOGICAL namespace, as opposed to an observation that
//! something this device had is gone.
//!
//! An observed removal (`FsChangeKind::ObservedRemoval`, from a watcher, a scan
//! or a journal replay) is evidence only where the row says an object was
//! here: a `Present` row's absence is a delete, a `Remote`, `Hydrating` or
//! `Evicting` row's absence is not. A [`SemanticDelete`] -- a platform
//! provider's `deleteItem` -- is the user acting on the namespace they saw, so
//! it is independent of any local object and applies to `Remote` rows too.
//!
//! What the user saw is what the delete covers. The set of live entries and
//! the version each had is captured when the delete is begun
//! ([`LocalChangeProcessor::begin_semantic_delete`]); an entry whose version
//! is not the one captured -- one a peer admitted, or replaced, after the
//! user's delete event -- was never seen by the user and is left alone.
