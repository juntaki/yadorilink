/// Why this path can never become a local change, or `None` if it can.
///
/// A thin wrapper over
/// [`yadorilink_root_authority::reserved_namespace::wire_path_admission_refusal`]
/// -- the single predicate DAG admission itself reads
/// (`dag_store::serving_authorization_index::validate_no_reserved_paths`,
/// on both the receiving and local-authoring call sites) -- turned into a
/// short reason string for the skip warnings.
///
/// ## Why local capture has to filter these at all
///
/// Because a refusal is not scoped to the path that caused it. Local
/// capture commits a whole debounce batch (`flush_pending_batch`) or scan
/// chunk (`reconcile_disk_with_ignore`) as ONE signed change, so the
/// emission refusing one path fails the entire batch -- every unrelated
/// file in it included. `flush_pending_batch` then logs and returns
/// `Ok(vec![])`, leaving the batch journaled dirty, and the backstop
/// re-drives the identical failing batch on the next sweep, and the next.
///
/// Observed directly on this tree, in `windows_path_hazard_conflict`:
///
/// ```text
/// WARN failed to commit a batched group of local mutations; left journaled
///      dirty for re-drive error=path "CON.txt" has a component that is not
///      portable to every platform this group may sync to
///      group_id="windows-path-hazard-group" batch_len=2
/// ```
///
/// every 5 seconds, indefinitely. The `batch_len=2` is the bug in one
/// number: the second entry was an ordinary file that merely shared a
/// debounce window with `CON.txt`. A POSIX user creating `CON.txt`,
/// `"notes.txt "` or `report<final>.txt` -- all legal on Linux and macOS --
/// silently stops that folder syncing **anything**. Nothing in the refusal
/// is gated on `cfg!(windows)` (deliberately: every peer must reach the
/// same verdict for the same wire path), so it hits every platform.
///
/// Skipping, not holding or erroring, is the right response: refusal is a
/// property of the name alone, so it can never resolve on a later attempt.
/// The file itself is never touched -- it stays exactly as the user wrote
/// it, it is simply not represented in the group's history, which is the
/// same end state admission was always going to enforce.

/// Converts `rel` (a path already relative to some root) into this crate's

/// represented losslessly as one. It closes two distinct silent-collision
/// hazards in the naive `rel.to_string_lossy().replace('\\', "/")` pattern:
///
/// - That naive code replaces `\` with `/` UNCONDITIONALLY, on every
///   platform. On Windows that's correct (the native separator IS `\`,
///   and the wire form needs `/`) — but on Unix, `\` is an ordinary, legal
///   filename BYTE, not a path separator (the native separator there is
///   already `/`). Blindly replacing it folded two genuinely different
///   real files onto the identical logical path string: a file literally
///   named `a\b.txt` and a nested file at `a/b.txt` both produced the
///   wire string `"a/b.txt"`. `Path::to_str`'s own text already uses each
///   platform's real separator, so gating the `\`→`/` substitution to
///   `#[cfg(windows)]` alone closes this without needing any Unix-side
///   logic at all.
/// - `to_string_lossy()` silently substitutes `�` (U+FFFD) for any
///   invalid UTF-8 byte sequence. Two DIFFERENT real files whose names
///   contain different non-UTF-8 byte sequences (common in practice: any
///   name that isn't valid UTF-8 at all, e.g. legacy Latin-1-encoded
///   filenames, or an archive/zip extracted from a non-UTF-8 locale) can
///   therefore silently collapse onto the identical logical path string.
///   `Path::to_str` returns `None` instead of substituting anything,
///   which every caller here now treats as "cannot safely sync this
///   path" (skip/suppress/no-op) rather than silently proceeding with a
///   corrupted string that might collide with something else.
///
/// This is a bounded mitigation, not a full fix: this crate's index/DAG/
/// wire representation is still fundamentally a UTF-8 `String`, so a
/// genuinely non-UTF-8 name still cannot be synced at all — it is now
/// refused outright rather than silently corrupted, which is strictly
/// better (no silent collision) but not the same as actually supporting
/// such names. The full fix — raw-byte (Unix) / WTF-16 (Windows) path
/// representation threaded through the wire protocol, DAG encoding, and
/// every index primary key — is a substantially larger redesign, tracked
/// as an open residual rather than attempted here.
