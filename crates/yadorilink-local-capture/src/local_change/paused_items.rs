//! Local capture's half of a paused item (see
//! `yadorilink_sync_sqlite::paused_items` for the whole contract).
//!
//! A local edit to a paused path is not authored. Authoring is what makes a
//! change servable to peers, and a change, once in history, is also the
//! parent of every later change of the group, so it cannot be withheld
//! from one peer exchange after the fact; holding it before authoring is
//! the only place the hold can live. Nothing is recorded instead -- in
//! particular not a dirty-journal row, which would block remote admission
//! of every change to that path for as long as the pause lasts. The edited
//! bytes on disk are the whole backlog, and
//! [`LocalChangeProcessor::capture_resumed_item`] reads them back on
//! resume. An edit captured then is parented on the version its bytes were
//! based on (the path's last placed state), not on whatever remote change
//! was admitted meanwhile, so an edit made on both sides while paused
//! surfaces as an ordinary conflict.
