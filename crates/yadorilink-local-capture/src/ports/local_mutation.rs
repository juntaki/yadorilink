//! The capability surface `LocalChangeProcessor` (`local_change.rs`) needs
//! from a replica-state type: committing a detected local edit (upsert or
//! delete) as a DAG-emitting index write, plus the dirty-path journal that
//! survives a crash between detection and that commit. Every method below
//! is called by `local_change.rs` today via `self.state.<method>`,
//! surveyed directly from that file. Three additions beyond that original
//! survey: `list_files`, used by the two production
//! `scan_existing_files`/reconcile call sites; and
//! `verify_root`/`open_root`, added because
//! `VerifiedRoot::verify`/`VerifiedRoot::open` need a concrete
//! replica-state reference that a trait object can't produce, so the port
//! grows a delegate that performs the concrete call internally instead of
//! exposing the concrete type.
