//! Connection-level admission control for the HTTP listener -- gates every
//! accepted TCP connection *before* any HTTP parsing or token-based
//! authorization happens.
//!
//! This exists independent of `lib.rs::build_router`'s request-level
//! `tower::limit::ConcurrencyLimitLayer`/`tower_http::timeout::TimeoutLayer`:
//! `axum::serve` spawns one long-lived task per *accepted* connection
//! unconditionally, before a single byte of that connection's request is
//! ever read (`handle_connection` calls the make-service, then
//! `tokio::spawn`s the connection-serving future, then hyper starts reading
//! from the socket) -- a request-level middleware, which only ever runs
//! once a complete HTTP request has been parsed off that socket, cannot
//! bound how many such tasks pile up from connections that never send a
//! complete request at all. Measured directly: a client that opens a
//! connection and sends nothing gets a task and an fd from this process
//! with no request-level layer ever having a chance to run.
//!
//! Two independent bounds, both applied before a connection is handed to
//! axum's own per-connection serving loop:
//!
//! - [`ConnLimitedListener`] caps how many connections can be actively
//!   served at once, via a semaphore acquired *before* this process even
//!   calls `accept(2)` for the next connection -- once the cap is reached,
//!   further connection attempts simply queue in the kernel's own accept
//!   backlog rather than consuming a userspace task/fd, until a permit
//!   frees up.
//! - [`LimitedIo`] closes a connection that has gone genuinely idle,
//!   releasing its permit -- otherwise a flood of connections that never
//!   let this adapter finish responding could fill every permit and hold
//!   them forever, starving legitimate traffic even though the total is
//!   bounded.
//!
//! This bounds a *passively* idle flood (nothing sent, or activity that
//! stopped and never resumed) to at most [`CONNECTION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`] per
//! connection. It does NOT bound an *actively* dribbling flood: a
//! connection that sends or receives even one byte per window renews its
//! own permit indefinitely, and enough such connections can still occupy
//! every slot and starve a legitimate request -- cheaply (on the order of
//! bytes per second across the whole flood), from any other local process
//! on the same machine, whether or not it holds this daemon's own auth
//! token. No timeout-shaped fix closes this residual -- see the "Why a
//! rolling idle timeout" section below for why an additional absolute
//! connection lifetime is the wrong answer here (it would kill genuine
//! long-lived SSE streams, this adapter's main use case, without even
//! stopping the attacker, who can just reconnect). This is a known,
//! accepted gap in the "other local users" part of this adapter's threat
//! model (see this crate's top-level doc comment): a hostile local
//! process can make this HTTP/dashboard adapter itself unreachable: it
//! cannot touch folder sync, which does not depend on this adapter at
//! all.
//!
//! # Why a rolling idle timeout, not a one-shot disarm
//!
//! An earlier version of this mechanism used a pair of one-shot deadlines
//! that were permanently *disarmed* once some attacker-observable condition
//! was met: the first successful write back to the client, or the byte
//! count read from the client crossing a fixed threshold. Both conditions
//! turned out to be unsound, for the same underlying reason -- the attacker
//! controls every byte sent on a connection they opened, so any fixed,
//! one-time condition phrased purely in terms of those bytes (or in terms
//! of a write this adapter is willing to produce in response to them) is
//! something the attacker can simply *arrange to satisfy once* and then
//! stop cooperating: send enough bytes to clear a byte-count threshold, or
//! complete enough of a legal (even ordinary, non-malicious-looking)
//! protocol exchange to provoke one write back, and the connection's
//! protective deadline is gone forever, even though the connection itself
//! goes on to do nothing at all afterward. That failure mode was
//! demonstrated concretely against two different exchanges: a well-formed,
//! completely idle HTTP/2 connection (the fixed 24-byte client preface plus
//! a single empty SETTINGS frame -- ordinary HTTP/2 handshake behavior,
//! nothing malformed about it), and an ordinary authenticated HTTP/1.1
//! request completed over keep-alive with zero protocol trickery at all.
//! Both permanently disarmed every deadline this module had, and the
//! connection could then sit open, holding its connection-slot permit,
//! indefinitely.
//!
//! [`LimitedIo`] instead tracks a single rolling deadline: the time of the
//! *last* successful read or write on the connection, refreshed by
//! [`CONNECTION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`] on every one, not disarmed by any of them.
//! This is sound against the same adversary specifically because it grants
//! no permanent exemption: no amount of legitimate-looking traffic sent
//! *once* buys a connection an escape from ever being checked again -- the
//! clock keeps getting pushed out only for as long as the connection
//! keeps doing something, read or write, and the instant it stops (for
//! whatever reason -- the attacker goes silent, or a genuine client's
//! connection dies without a clean TCP close) the existing deadline, already
//! ticking, elapses and reclaims the slot. There is no code path in this
//! module that ever stops checking a connection's activity for the rest of
//! its life the way the old first-write/byte-count disarms did.
//!
//! # Choosing the idle window
//!
//! [`CONNECTION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`] has to satisfy two things at once, in
//! tension with each other:
//!
//! - Long enough that it never fires out from under a request this adapter
//!   is legitimately still working on. `lib.rs::REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (30s) is
//!   the maximum time this adapter itself allows a request to spend being
//!   actively processed before it gives up and writes back its own `408`;
//!   while that's happening, the connection may see no read or write
//!   activity at all (a slow/hung control-socket round trip produces
//!   nothing on the client-facing TCP connection until either an answer or
//!   that 30s backstop fires). If the connection-level idle timeout were
//!   close to or shorter than that 30s figure, it could win the race and
//!   tear down the raw connection before the request-level machinery ever
//!   gets to write its own well-formed response -- exactly the mistake an
//!   earlier version of this module made with a 5s deadline that always
//!   lost that race against both `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (30s) and
//!   `control_client.rs`'s own 5s control-socket timeout, silently making
//!   the documented "hung daemon -> `503`" contract unreachable: the
//!   client observed a raw connection reset instead of the intended
//!   response. [`CONNECTION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`] is set well clear of that 30s
//!   figure to give this comfortable headroom -- but this is an assumption
//!   this constant relies on, not an independently enforced bound: it
//!   depends on `queue_delay + active_processing` (a single connection's
//!   time spent waiting behind `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` plus its own
//!   active-processing time, see `lib.rs::REQUEST_TIMEOUT`'s doc comment
//!   for why queue time specifically isn't covered by that timer either)
//!   staying under this constant's 60s. That holds comfortably for this
//!   adapter's real request shapes (a handful of milliseconds of queueing
//!   at most, since only a token holder's requests can ever be slow, and
//!   each holds at most one 5s control-socket round trip), but is not
//!   something this code checks or enforces on its own.
//! - Short enough to still firmly bound how long a truly idle connection
//!   (attacker-controlled or otherwise) can pin a connection-slot permit.
//!
//! [`CONNECTION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`] is a flat multiple of `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`,
//! chosen to leave comfortable headroom for scheduling jitter and any
//! incidental queuing delay on top of that 30s figure, while remaining far
//! short of anything resembling an unbounded hang. SSE streams stay well
//! inside this window on their own: `handlers::events`'s poller writes a
//! fresh frame at least every `POLL_INTERVAL` (2s) when the underlying
//! status changes, and even on a perfectly idle daemon where it never has
//! new data to send, axum's own `KeepAlive::default()` (`events.rs`)
//! writes a comment frame at least every 15s -- both comfortably inside
//! [`CONNECTION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`], so a real, ongoing SSE stream keeps
//! resetting its own deadline forever, exactly as intended.
