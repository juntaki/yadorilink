//! A thin localhost HTTP/REST + SSE adapter in front of the daemon's
//! existing control-socket IPC (`yadorilink-ipc-proto`'s `daemonctl`
//! protocol, dispatched daemon-side by `yadorilink-daemon::control_socket`).
//! This crate adds no sync/business logic of its own -- every handler in
//! `handlers/` builds a `DaemonControlRequest`, sends it over
//! [`control_client::ControlClient`] (which dials the same control socket
//! the CLI already does, using the same framing), and translates the
//! `DaemonControlResponse` into JSON. See `handlers/mod.rs`'s module doc
//! comment for the JSON shapes and `handlers/events.rs` for why `/api/events`
//! is polling-based rather than push-based.
//!
//! # Security model
//!
//! This adapter is meant to be safely exposed on a machine with other local
//! users, or reachable from a browser that also has other tabs open, so
//! every request is checked at three independent, mandatory layers before
//! it reaches a handler -- see `security.rs` for the full reasoning:
//!
//! 1. `Host` header must name one of this adapter's own bound loopback
//!    addresses (defends against DNS rebinding).
//! 2. `Origin` header, if present, must be this adapter's own origin or an
//!    explicitly configured dev-server origin -- never a wildcard (defends
//!    against a malicious page's browser-issued cross-origin request).
//! 3. Every `/api/*` request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
//!    matching the token this daemon run generated at startup (`token.rs`).
//!
//! The token is delivered to callers (including this crate's own bundled
//! Web UI) **only** via that header -- never a cookie, and never a query
//! string. A cookie would be attached by the browser automatically to
//! *any* request to this origin, including one triggered by a malicious
//! cross-origin page, which is exactly the CSRF vector layer 3 exists to
//! close; a query string ends up in browser history, proxy/server access
//! logs, and the `Referer` header of any same-origin link the page
//! navigates to next. `handlers/events.rs`'s own doc comment explains why
//! this also rules out the browser's native `EventSource` API for
//! `/api/events` (it has no way to attach a header) -- this crate's bundled
//! Web UI (`webui.rs`) instead reads that endpoint with a plain
//! `fetch()` and parses the `text/event-stream` framing itself.
//!
//! Binding is loopback-only and not configurable past that: [`bind`] always
//! binds `127.0.0.1`, and best-effort also `[::1]` (a failure to bind the
//! IPv6 side -- e.g. no IPv6 support on the host -- is logged and does not
//! prevent serving on IPv4). There is no code path in this crate that binds
//! any other interface.
//!
//! A failed `[::1]` bind is more than a missing feature, though: `localhost`
//! resolves to `[::1]` first on many systems, so if some OTHER local process
//! grabs `[::1]:<port>` before this one starts, that other process -- not
//! this adapter -- is what a browser reaches by navigating to
//! `http://localhost:<port>`, at an origin this adapter's own Origin check
//! would otherwise treat as trusted, and that a browser's `localStorage`
//! treats as the SAME storage bucket the bundled Web UI persists its bearer
//! token into regardless of which process currently answers there. [`bind`]
//! only adds `localhost`/`[::1]` to `AppState::allowed_hosts`/
//! `allowed_origins` when the `[::1]` bind actually succeeded -- i.e. only
//! when this process can actually back up trusting that identity.
