//! `GET /api/events` -- a Server-Sent-Events stream.
//!
//! `control_socket.rs` is pure request/response (confirmed against its full
//! dispatch table): there is no daemon-side "subscribe to status changes"
//! IPC call this adapter could forward. A real push-based event bus does
//! exist in-process (`RuntimeTelemetry`'s `broadcast::Sender<StatusPush>`),
//! but it is private to `yadorilink-daemon`, wired only to the separate
//! shell-integration IPC surface, and covers only per-file materialization
//! state -- not the links/peers/conflicts/overall-state data this
//! dashboard's `/api/status` already exposes. Reaching into it would mean
//! either widening `yadorilink-daemon`'s internal visibility or duplicating
//! its wiring in a second crate, both bigger changes than this adapter's
//! "thin translation, no new daemon capability" scope allows for a first
//! pass.
//!
//! So this stream is built the same way any client polling `GET /api/status`
//! in a loop would build one -- it uses no daemon capability beyond what
//! `/api/status` itself already forwards: a fixed-interval `Status` request,
//! re-sent on this same `ControlClient`. It emits a new `event: status` only
//! when the serialized snapshot actually changed since the last poll, so an
//! idle daemon does not spam the stream. A transient control-socket failure
//! (daemon briefly unreachable) emits `event: error` and keeps polling,
//! rather than closing the stream -- from a dashboard's point of view, a
//! blip in reachability is exactly the kind of thing it should show, not
//! disconnect for.
//!
//! Two things bound this loop's lifetime and count, both load-bearing:
//!
//! - Disconnect detection cannot rely solely on a failed `tx.send` --  on an
//!   idle daemon (the common headless/NAS case) the serialized snapshot is
//!   byte-stable, so the loop can go arbitrarily long without ever calling
//!   `tx.send` at all, and therefore never notices a dropped receiver. Every
//!   loop iteration instead races the next poll tick against
//!   `tx.closed()`, which resolves as soon as axum drops the response body
//!   (client disconnect, tab close, or the bundled Web UI's own
//!   reconnect-every-few-seconds loop moving on) -- see the comment above
//!   the `tokio::select!` near the bottom of this file for how a leaked
//!   poller was actually measured before this fix.
//! - `AppState::sse_slots` bounds how many of these polling tasks can be
//!   alive at once, independent of the disconnect fix above: even with
//!   prompt cleanup, a burst of concurrent connections (or a client that
//!   doesn't cleanly close) should have a hard ceiling on the resulting
//!   control-socket polling load rather than an unbounded one.
