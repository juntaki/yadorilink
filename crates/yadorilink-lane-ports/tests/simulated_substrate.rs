//! Proof that this project's substrate runs with no operating-system socket
//! under it.
//!
//! The block, service and snapshot lanes are why a multi-device scenario
//! could not be simulated at all. `PeerSyncSession` requires
//! `SessionTransports`, and the only implementation that is not in-process is
//! `PeerTransports` over a real iroh endpoint, which binds real UDP below
//! anything a simulator can intercept. That left a scenario two options, both
//! bad: carry blocks over an in-process channel no injected fault can touch,
//! or add a second block path to a transport the architecture deliberately
//! closed.
//!
//! This is the third option. iroh's custom-transport seam replaces the
//! bottom-most datagram carrier and nothing else. Everything above it --
//! iroh's QUIC, TLS and stream multiplexing, `PeerLink`, `PeerTransports`,
//! the lane streams, `PreparedSnapshots` -- is the code a shipped daemon
//! runs. The carrier and its address lookup both come from upstream's own
//! `TestNetwork`; this crate reimplements neither.
//!
//! No fault is injected here. That is the next step, and doing it before this
//! one was green would have meant debugging two new things at once.
