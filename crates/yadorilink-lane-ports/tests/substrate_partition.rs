//! Partition and heal, on the simulated substrate and nothing else.
//!
//! The fault lives in the datagram carrier (`sim_fault`), so nothing these
//! tests exercise above it -- `PeerTransports`, the lane framing, iroh's QUIC
//! -- knows a fault exists. That is the property being relied on: a partition
//! a session could see the shape of would be a harness artefact rather than a
//! network one.
//!
//! No scenario harness here, and no virtual clock. Bringing either in before
//! partition semantics were closed would mean a failure could be the carrier
//! or the harness, with no way to tell which.
