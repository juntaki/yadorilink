//! Block traffic on the substrate's block lane.
//!
//! The block protocol was already transport-agnostic: it speaks
//! [`PeerBlockStream`], a length-prefixed header followed by a raw body, on a
//! stream of its own. Nothing about it assumed the legacy QUIC channel. So
//! moving it onto the reconciliation substrate is a matter of presenting a
//! lane stream through that same port — the protocol above does not change,
//! and does not learn which transport it is on.
//!
//! Its own lane, rather than sharing one, is the whole reason [`Lane::Block`]
//! was reserved: a block body is large and slow, and a reconciliation round
//! stuck behind one would make discovery latency a function of transfer size.
//! Three lanes, three independent flow-control domains, one connection.
