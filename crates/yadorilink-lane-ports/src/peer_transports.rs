//! The per-peer transports a session opens streams through.
//!
//! A session talks to exactly one peer, so each of these is bound to one and
//! takes no peer argument — there is no way to pass the wrong one because
//! there is none to pass. What they share is a connection: blocks, service
//! RPCs and snapshots all ride lanes of the same iroh connection to that peer,
//! which is what makes their flow-control separation mean anything.
//!
//! The connection is resolved per call rather than held. A link that has gone
//! away is redialled, and a peer whose address the netmap no longer carries
//! simply cannot be reached — the same answer production gives.
