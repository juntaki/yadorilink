//! Service RPCs on the substrate's service lane.
//!
//! One stream per logical RPC. The alternative — one shared stream, a receive
//! loop, and a request-id map — is the shape the lane classes exist to remove,
//! and rebuilding it here would put it straight back: a slow RPC would delay
//! every other one, and the correlation table would be another thing that can
//! mismatch, leak or grow. A QUIC stream already is the correlation.
//!
//! What rides here is classified by shape, not by which legacy frame used to
//! carry it:
//!
//! ```text
//!   small request / control metadata  →  Service   (this lane)
//!   proof-carrying or history bulk    →  Bundle
//!   content bytes                     →  Block
//! ```
//!
//! So a rebootstrap *request* and the manifest answering it belong here; the
//! objects that manifest names do not.
