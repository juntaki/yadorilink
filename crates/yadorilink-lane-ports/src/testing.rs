//! A real substrate endpoint for a test that builds its own peer sessions.
//!
//! A `PeerSyncSession` requires transports; the daemon supplies them from a
//! `SyncStack`, and a test below the daemon needs the same thing from
//! something smaller. What it must not be is a null transport: a session that
//! exists and can never carry anything is exactly the state this cutover
//! removes from production, and reintroducing it under a test-only name would
//! leave every later constructor and lifecycle change unchecked by the tests
//! meant to check it.
//!
//! So this is a real iroh endpoint, real lanes, and the same adapters
//! production uses. What it leaves out is everything above the transport:
//! there is no netmap here, so a peer is addressed by whatever address the
//! test registered for it, and authorization is the session's own business
//! exactly as in production.
//!
//! Not dialling is fine. A test whose subject never fetches a block simply
//! never opens a block lane — "unused" and "unusable" are different, and only
//! the second is what production had to stop being able to represent.
