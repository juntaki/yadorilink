//! The file backend: owner-only, atomically replaced, and refused outright if
//! anyone else can read it.
//!
//! This is a supported backend, not a canary fallback. It is what makes a
//! headless Linux host deployable, and it is held to the same standard as the
//! OS keyring: the secret is never visible to another user, and a write that
//! is interrupted leaves the previous document intact rather than a truncated
//! one.
//!
//! # Why a permissive mode is refused rather than repaired
//!
//! `chmod 600` on a file that has already been group-readable does not
//! un-read it. Whoever could read it has had the refresh token and the client
//! private key, which together are the authority to continue the session
//! Silently tightening the mode and
//! carrying on would hide exactly the event that should send the user to
//! revoke the registration, so the store refuses and says so.
