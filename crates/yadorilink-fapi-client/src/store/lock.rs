//! The cross-process refresh-token rotation lock.
//!
//! # Why this has to exist
//!
//! Refresh tokens rotate. The Authorization Server hands back a new one and
//! kills the one just spent, and replaying a spent refresh token does not fail
//! harmlessly -- it fires the reuse defence, which tears down the whole grant
//! family (measured against the deployed server). The CLI
//! and the daemon run as separate processes against the same stored
//! credential, so without a lock the ordinary case of "the user runs a command
//! while the daemon is refreshing" is two processes presenting the same
//! refresh token. The server is right to revoke; the user is logged out of
//! everything for no reason they can see.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! An advisory whole-file lock (`flock` on Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows) on a
//! zero-byte file in the config directory, held across *read the stored token,
//! refresh, persist the rotated token*. The file lives in the config directory
//! whichever backend holds the secret, because the OS keyring has no lock of
//! its own and because the CLI and the daemon already agree on that directory.
//!
//! The lock file is never deleted. Unlinking a file another process is waiting
//! on gives the next waiter a lock on a file nobody else can see, which is
//! worse than no lock at all -- it succeeds.
//!
//! # Why a bounded retry loop rather than a blocking acquire
//!
//! `lock_exclusive` blocks the calling thread for as long as the holder takes,
//! which in a daemon means parking a reactor thread on a network round trip
//! happening in another process. `try_lock_exclusive` plus a short sleep needs
//! no blocking pool to exist -- which also keeps this crate free of
//! `spawn_blocking`, whose absence is what lets it link into a build whose
//! tokio is the simulation shim.
//!
//! A timeout is a refusal, not a "carry on anyway". Proceeding without the
//! lock is precisely the grant-destroying case.
