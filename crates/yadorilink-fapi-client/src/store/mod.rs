//! The credential store: one implementation, two first-class backends.
//!
//! # What is stored, and what deliberately is not
//!
//! Three things, and they are one record because they are useless apart: the
//! `client_id`, the **client private key**, and the **refresh token**. The
//! client key authenticates the installation; the refresh token is the
//! authority to continue a session; and a refresh token carries no DPoP
//! binding (measured against the deployed server), so *the client key plus the refresh token is the
//! session*. Splitting them across separate entries would mean a half-written
//! save leaves a store that looks configured and is not.
//!
//! The **access token is never persisted**. It lives for five minutes
//! (`coordination-worker/src/auth/provider/config.ts`), it is a process-local
//! cache in [`crate::CredentialManager`], and writing it to disk would put a
//! bearer-shaped credential at rest to save one HTTP round trip per process
//! start.
//!
//! The **DPoP key is never persisted** either. It is per-process proof
//! material; a fresh one is generated at startup and the refresh exchange
//! re-establishes the sender constraint onto it.
//!
//! # Two backends, neither a fallback
//!
//! [`Backend::Keyring`] is the OS-native store. [`Backend::File`] is an
//! owner-only file. The file backend is **not** a degraded mode: a headless
//! Linux host has no Secret Service, and requiring one there is what made this
//! undeployable. So it is the default on Linux, and the keyring is the default
//! on macOS and Windows, and either can be selected explicitly.
//!
//! What this module will not do is *fall back*. A keyring that cannot be
//! reached is an error naming `YADORILINK_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file`, never a
//! silent switch to a different store -- silently changing where a credential
//! lives is how an installation ends up anonymous while reporting success.
//!
//! # Refusing a half-configured store
//!
//! Modelled on `yadorilink_daemon::path_witness_sink::configure_from_env`: the
//! combinations that cannot mean anything are named and refused at startup,
//! rather than defaulted into something that starts cleanly and is wrong.
//! `YADORILINK_CREDENTIAL_FILE` with `YADORILINK_CREDENTIAL_STORE=keyring` is
//! refused because one of the two was going to be ignored; an unknown store
//! name is refused rather than treated as the default; and a record missing
//! any of its three fields is refused as `HalfConfigured` rather than read as
//! "not enrolled", because the two want opposite responses -- one is
//! `yadorilink login`, the other is a corrupted store that a login would
//! silently paper over.
//!
//! # There is exactly one way to be "not enrolled"
//!
//! **The backend holding no value.** That is the whole list. [`Document`] has
//! no optional member, so a document that exists names a complete
//! [`Credentials`], and every other byte sequence is a refusal:
//!
//! | stored bytes | outcome |
//! |---|---|
//! | *(no value in the backend)* | `Ok(None)` -- not enrolled |
//! | `{"format":2,"client":{..four fields..}}` | `Ok(Some(..))` |
//! | `{"format":2}` | refused: missing `client` |
//! | a member this build does not define | refused: unknown field |
//! | `{"format":1,..}` | refused: `UnsupportedFormat` |
//! | anything else | refused: [`StoreError::Unreadable`] |
//!
//! This is not defensive parsing for its own sake. A document that parsed
//! leniently made two states reachable that the product must never enter. A
//! `client`-less document read as `Ok(None)` reported corruption as absence,
//! and the caller's response to absence is `yadorilink login`, which would
//! have papered over the damage with a second registration. And a document
//! carrying members this build does not define read as valid, so the deleted
//! `legacy_session` plane -- and an `access_token`, the one credential this
//! store exists to never write down -- could sit in the file while the store
//! reported a clean read. Refusing the *shape* is what makes those
//! unrepresentable; refusing them one by one would only be a list that the
//! next member is missing from.
//!
//! No migration is offered for any of it. An unreadable pre-release credential
//! means re-enrol, so [`CredentialStore::save`] replaces the document without
//! reading it -- refusing to read a damaged store is only a policy if the
//! remedy it names can actually be carried out.
