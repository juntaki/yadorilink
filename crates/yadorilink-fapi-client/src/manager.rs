//! The credential manager: a live access token, for as long as the process
//! runs.
//!
//! # The problem it exists to solve
//!
//! The access token's lifetime is **five minutes**
//! (`coordination-worker/src/auth/provider/config.ts`). A daemon that reads a
//! token at startup and passes it around as a value is authenticated for five
//! minutes and broken for the rest of the day. So the token is not a value
//! that callers hold; it is something they ask for, and the asking is what
//! refreshes it.
//!
//! # What is cached, and what is persisted
//!
//! The access token is cached **in this process only** and is never written
//! anywhere. What is persisted is the client key and the refresh token, and
//! rotation of the latter is the only thing this type writes.
//!
//! # The DPoP key is fresh every process, deliberately
//!
//! A refresh token carries no DPoP binding (measured): the server
//! copies `jkt` onto a refresh token only for a client authenticating with
//! `none`, and this client authenticates with `private_key_jwt`. So refreshing
//! under a DPoP key that never saw the original grant is *correct*, and it is
//! what lets the DPoP key be per-process rather than persisted.
//!
//! That is a property of the server, not a law, so it is asserted rather than
//! relied on silently:
//! `tests/credential_manager.rs::refreshing_happens_under_a_dpop_key_the_grant_has_never_seen`
//! forces the case, and the live counterpart in `tests/vertical_flow.rs`
//! proves it against a real server. If a later server change starts binding
//! refresh tokens, those tests fail rather than the daemon quietly losing its
//! session at every restart.
//!
//! # Rotation is the dangerous part
//!
//! A refresh response rotates the refresh token and kills the one presented.
//! Replaying a spent one does not fail harmlessly -- it fires the reuse
//! defence and tears down the whole grant family. Two processes sharing one
//! stored credential is the ordinary case here, not a corner: the user runs a
//! CLI command while the daemon is running. So every refresh happens under the
//! cross-process lock in [`crate::store`], and the refresh token is re-read
//! from the store *inside* the lock rather than trusted from memory -- because
//! the other process may have rotated it since this one last looked.
//!
//! A refresh that does *not* rotate is a failure, not a warning. This module
//! used to log one, leave the spent token in the store, and hand the caller an
//! access token: a session that was already over, reported as success, good for
//! one more five-minute window before failing somewhere that could not explain
//! why. The requirement now lives in [`crate::TokenResponse`], so by the time
//! `refresh_now` has a value the rotation has happened, and the store write
//! below has no branch.

/// that is refreshing. That is correct for a short-lived CLI process and for
/// every test in this crate, and it is why this type exists as an injectable
/// seam rather than as a hardcoded `tokio::spawn`: this crate is linked into
/// `yadorilink-daemon`'s deterministic-simulation build, whose tokio has no
/// runtime to spawn onto (see this crate's `Cargo.toml`), so nothing in
/// ordinary use may assume one exists.
///
/// The daemon overrides it (`yadorilink-daemon::credential_store`), and the
/// reason is its own essential-task supervisor
/// (`supervise::EssentialTasks::shutdown`): the instant any ONE essential task
/// fails, every other one is aborted immediately, and refreshing a credential
/// is ordinary work an essential task does inline. If that abort lands
/// between the server rotating the refresh token and this process's write of
/// the rotation, the store is left holding a token the server has already
/// killed -- permanently, since rotation is one-shot and nothing later
/// re-derives a value that was never persisted. A real crash (`SIGKILL`,
/// power loss) cannot be defended against this way; nothing the process being
/// killed does can survive that. But an abort this same process issues
/// against itself is not a crash, so the daemon runs the write detached from
/// whatever task asked for the refresh -- a plain `tokio::spawn`, holding no
/// `AbortHandle` that `EssentialTasks::shutdown` could ever reach -- so
/// aborting the caller can no longer cancel a write the network round trip
