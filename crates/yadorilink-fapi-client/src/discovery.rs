//! The Authorization Server's metadata document (RFC 8414).
//!
//! Only the members this client actually uses are modelled. Everything else in
//! the document is ignored rather than rejected, so the server can advertise
//! more without breaking the client.
//!
//! # This is a profile requirement, not a capability negotiation
//!
//! This client talks to exactly one Authorization Server: the one configured in
//! `coordination-worker/src/auth/provider/config.ts`. Its discovery document is
//! not an unknown quantity to be probed and accommodated -- it is a fixed
//! profile this repository owns. So [`Metadata::unmet_profile_requirements`]
//! asks "does this server match the profile?", never "what can this server do
//! that I might also be able to do?".
//!
//! The difference shows up on the *absent* member. A negotiating client treats
//! an empty `code_challenge_methods_supported` as "unknown, probably fine"; a
//! profile client treats it as a server that has not said it will accept an
//! S256 challenge. Every capability below is a defence -- PAR keeps the
//! authorization request out of a browser-visible URL, PKCE binds the code to
//! the requester, `private_key_jwt` is the only client credential that exists
//! here, DPoP is the access token's only sender constraint -- and a defence
//! that is "probably" present is one this client will not rely on.

/// The subset of `/.well-known/openid-configuration` this client reads.
///
/// Every absolute URL here is **issuer-derived**: the server builds them from
/// its own configuration and knows nothing about the socket a client dialed.
/// They are the source of truth for DPoP `htu` and for the assertion audience;
/// the socket is only ever a transport detail.
