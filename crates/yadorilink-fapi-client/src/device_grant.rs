//! The RFC 8628 device authorization grant -- enrolment on a host with no
//! browser.
//!
//! # Why the product needs it
//!
//! The authorization-code flow needs a user agent on the same machine and a
//! loopback listener to catch the redirect. A headless Linux host has neither.
//! The device grant moves the browser leg to whatever device the user already
//! has one on, and leaves this process polling.
//!
//! # The three things this server does that the RFC does not describe
//!
//! 1. **`POST /device/auth` is client-authenticated.** `private_key_jwt` with
//!    the installation's ES256 key, exactly like the token endpoint. RFC 8628
//!    describes a public client sending only `client_id`; this deployment
//!    registers confidential clients, so an unauthenticated device
//!    authorization request is refused.
//! 2. **No DPoP proof at `/device/auth`.** The library adds `dpop_jkt` to the
//!    parameter allow-list for the authorization and PAR endpoints only, so
//!    the device-authorization request pins no key and a proof sent there
//!    would be ignored. The sender constraint is established at `/token`, on
//!    whichever key signs the proof there.
//! 3. **`interval` and `slow_down` are YadoriLink's, not the library's.**
//!    `oidc-provider` 9.12.0 implements neither; the Worker wraps the endpoint
//!    to supply `interval` and to answer `slow_down`. A client that ignores
//!    `slow_down` therefore gets it from a real rate decision, not from a
//!    library default, and RFC 8628 section 3.5's "add five seconds" is the
//!    correct response.
//!
//! # `offline_access` without `prompt=consent`
//!
//! The authorization-code flow only receives a refresh token when the pushed
//! request carried `prompt=consent` (measured against the deployed server). The
//! device flow does not: `prompt` is not in the device endpoints' parameter
//! allow-list at all, and `check_scope.js` only strips `offline_access` over a
//! missing consent prompt when `prompt` is a parameter of that endpoint. So
//! the scope alone is enough here, and sending `prompt` would be rejected as
//! an unknown parameter rather than helping.
