//! The credential an authenticated Coordination API request is made with.
//!
//! # Why this type exists rather than a `&str`
//!
//! Before this module, both clients of the Coordination API passed a token
//! around as a string: the CLI's `http_client` took `Option<&str>` and called
//! `bearer_auth`, and the daemon captured one `access_token: String` at startup
//! and cloned it into every subsystem. Two things are wrong with that shape and
//! only one of them is about types.
//!
//! The first is arithmetic. An access token on this plane lives **five
//! minutes** (`coordination-worker/src/auth/provider/config.ts`). A value
//! captured at startup is a daemon that is authenticated until its first coffee
//! break. A token therefore cannot be a value a subsystem *holds*; it has to be
//! something it *asks for*, and the asking is what refreshes it.
//!
//! The second is that a token alone is not a credential. The Coordination API
//! is a DPoP resource server
//! (`coordination-worker/src/auth/provider/resource.ts`): it wants
//! `Authorization: DPoP <token>` **and** a proof signed by the key that token
//! was issued against, bound to this request's method and URL and to this
//! token. A caller holding only the token cannot construct a request that will
//! be accepted, and -- more to the point -- a caller holding only the token
//! *looks* like it can.
//!
//! # The type-level property, stated exactly
//!
//! [`CoordinationAuth`] is a newtype over an `Arc<CredentialManager>` and a
//! parsed issuer. It is **not an enum**: there is no second plane, no
//! `Option`, and no variant that carries a bare token. The only constructor is
//! [`CoordinationAuth::new`], which takes an `Arc<CredentialManager>`, and the
//! only way to obtain a `CredentialManager` is over a [`crate::FapiClient`]
//! bound to this installation's registered `client_id` and its ES256 client
//! key. There is no constructor anywhere in this workspace that takes an access
//! token.
//!
//! So "an authenticated Coordination request built from a string" is not a
//! state the program can enter, and it is not a state a test can fabricate
//! either: the legacy `sessions`-table plane used to be expressible as
//! `Plane::LegacySession(String)` and that variant, its constructor, its
//! `is_legacy` predicate and the `Bearer` branch of [`Self::authorize`] have all
//! been deleted along with the Worker's `authorizeLegacySession`.
//!
//! ## The shortcut that had to be closed for that to be true
//!
//! Deleting `LegacySession(String)` was not sufficient, and the gap is worth
//! recording because it was reachable with only this crate's ordinary public
//! API and no unsafe, no test feature and no second plane:
//!
//! ```text
//! FapiClient::from_metadata(/* three hand-written members */)   // infallible
//!   -> CredentialManager::with_client(client, store)            // public
//!   -> manager.seed(&TokenResponse { access_token: "anything", .. })
//!   -> CoordinationAuth::new(Arc::new(manager))                 // authenticated
//! ```
//!
//! Every step was public, `TokenResponse`'s fields were all `pub`, and the
//! result was a `CoordinationAuth` that would sign real DPoP proofs over a
//! bare string a caller chose. The enum was gone; the state was still
//! reachable, one level down.
//!
//! Both rungs are now removed rather than discouraged.
//! [`crate::FapiClient::from_metadata`] returns a `Result` and applies the same
//! profile check discovery does, so a client cannot exist over a document
//! nobody vetted; and [`crate::TokenResponse`] has private fields and no public
//! constructor, so the only way to obtain one is a checked response from that
//! server. `seed` and `with_client` stay public and are no longer a shortcut,
//! because their arguments can no longer be fabricated.
//!
//! # One proof per request, and why nothing here is cached
//!
//! A DPoP proof's `jti` is replay-detected server-side, and the Authorization
//! Server and the Resource Server deliberately share one replay namespace
//! (`resource.ts::spendProofJti`). So a proof is minted per request and never
//! reused -- not across a retry, not across a redirect. The access token is
//! cached, by [`CredentialManager`], which is the one place that knows when it
//! dies.
//!
//! # `htu` comes from the issuer, never from the socket
//!
//! The resource server builds the `htu` it expects as
//! `new URL(new URL(request.url).pathname, AS_ISSUER)` -- the request's path
//! against the *configured* issuer origin, never the incoming `Host`. It has to:
//! comparing against a caller-supplied origin would let the caller choose what
//! its own proof is checked against. So this module mints `htu` the same way,
//! from the discovery document's issuer and the request's path, and a client
//! dialing `http://127.0.0.1:8787` still signs `https://<issuer>/devices/register`.
