//! Fixed-size block splitting (Syncthing-proven fixed-size blocks,
//! content-defined chunking deferred by default) is the default, plus an
//! opt-in, size-gated content-defined chunking (CDC) path for large files
//! edited internally rather than appended to or replaced wholesale (VM
//! images, databases, large project files), where fixed-size blocks
//! re-transfer everything after an edit point due to boundary shift.
//! Blocks are content-addressed and stored via [`crate::BlockContentStore`],
//! giving free local dedup: an identical block from any other file/version

//!
//! Moved here from `yadorilink-sync-core::chunker` in Phase 7D-8.1 --
//! `chunk_file`/`chunk_file_content_defined`'s only production dependencies
//! were already [`crate::BlockContentStore`] and
//! `yadorilink_replica_domain::file::BlockInfo`, both already at or below
//! this crate in the dependency graph (`yadorilink-sync-core::chunker`'s
//! other functions -- `reconstruct_file`, `write_placeholder`,
//! `materialize_symlink*`, `apply_unix_mode`, the `verify_*_target_within_*`
//! guards -- were already thin `SyncError`-converting wrappers over this
//! crate's `materialize_write` module as of Phase 7D-6, and stay in
//! `yadorilink-sync-core` unchanged, since `yadorilink-sync-core` callers
//! still need a `SyncError`-returning entry point for them).
//!
//! `unix_mode_from_metadata` (a 6-line `std::fs::Metadata` read, zero
//! dependencies of its own) moved alongside for the same reason: it feeds
//! exactly the same file-capture call sites `chunk_file`/
//! `chunk_file_content_defined` do.

///   overlapping, each block's fsync.
