//! What opening a store does, and deliberately does not do.
//!
//! **Does not**: read a single payload byte, hash anything, or rebuild the
//! index. The index *is* the metadata; re-deriving it from the segments
//! would make startup cost proportional to the bytes the store holds,
//! which is the specific failure the earlier packed-store prototype had
//! and the reason it could never be the canonical store.
//!
//! **Does**: reconcile each segment's physical length against the
//! `durable_end` the index recorded for it, and resolve the three
//! discrepancies a crash can leave.
//!
//! | on disk vs. index | what it means | what happens |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `len > durable_end` | bytes were appended (perhaps fsynced) but their transaction never committed | truncate the orphan tail |
//! | `len == durable_end` | clean | nothing |
//! | `len < durable_end` | the file lost bytes the index still points at | drop exactly the mappings that no longer fit, and say so |
//! | file absent, index row present | the file was lost | drop every mapping in it |
//! | file present, no index row | a segment was created by a group that never committed | delete it |
//!
//! The third and fourth rows are the self-healing ones. Refusing to start
//! would be the wrong kind of fail-closed: the blocks are re-fetchable
//! from any peer that has them, and a store that cannot start cannot
//! re-fetch anything. What matters is that the store never *claims* a
//! block it cannot serve -- so the mappings go, `present_blocks` and `get`
//! agree again, and the layer above re-acquires the content.
//!
//! Cost is `O(number of segments)` metadata operations plus, only when
//! damage is found, one index query over the damaged segment's own rows.
