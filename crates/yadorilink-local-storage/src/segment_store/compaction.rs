//! Reclaiming the space a deleted block leaves behind.
//!
//! Deleting a block drops its mapping and debits its segment; it moves no
//! bytes, because a segment is immutable below `durable_end` and rewriting
//! it in place would break every reader currently `pread`ing it. Space
//! comes back later, in bulk, by copying whatever is still live out of a
//! mostly-dead segment and retiring the original.
//!
//! # Crash semantics, by construction
//!
//! The copies are appended and fsynced through the *same* single writer
//! and the *same* ordering an ingest commit uses, and the mapping swap is
//! one transaction. That gives four windows, and a valid copy is reachable
//! from the index in all of them:
//!
//! | crash point | index points at | file state |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | during the copy | the old segment | new segment holds unreferenced bytes |
//! | after the new segment's `fsync`, before the swap | the old segment | both copies durable, new one orphaned |
//! | after the swap, before the old file is deleted | the new segment | both copies present, old one retired |
//! | after the delete | the new segment | only the new copy |
//!
//! Recovery cleans up rows one and two by truncating the orphan tail, and
//! row three by deleting retired files. None of them can leave a mapping
//! without bytes.
//!
//! # Races with readers
//!
//! A reader holds no lock and may be mid-`pread` on a segment that is
//! being retired underneath it. On Unix an already-open descriptor keeps
//! working after the unlink, so that reader finishes normally. The window
//! that remains is narrow and specific -- a reader that resolved a mapping
//! *before* the swap and opens the file *after* the delete -- and `get`
//! closes it by re-resolving the mapping and retrying rather than by
//! locking anything. On Windows a delete can fail outright while a handle
//! is open; that is not an error condition here, it just means the file is
//! reclaimed on a later pass.
