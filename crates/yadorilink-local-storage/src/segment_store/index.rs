//! The persistent block index: the store's canonical metadata.
//!
//! This database -- not a scan of the segment files -- is what says which
//! blocks exist and where. That is the whole reason startup is
//! `O(segments)` rather than `O(bytes)`: nothing ever re-derives the
//! mapping by reading payloads.
//!
//! # The invariant every write here upholds
//!
//! **A mapping this index holds always points at bytes that are already
//! durable in their segment.** The commit sequence enforces it by
//! ordering, not by checking: a segment's `fsync` completes before the
//! transaction that records any of its new blocks begins. A crash before
//! that transaction leaves durable bytes with no mapping (recovery
//! truncates them); a crash after it leaves a mapping whose bytes were
//! fsynced strictly earlier. There is no interleaving that produces a
//! mapping to non-durable bytes.
//!
//! `synchronous = FULL` under WAL, inherited from the shared SQLite
//! runtime, is what makes "the transaction committed" mean the commit
//! survives power loss -- without it this index would report mappings that
//! a crash could take back while the segment bytes they point at stayed.
