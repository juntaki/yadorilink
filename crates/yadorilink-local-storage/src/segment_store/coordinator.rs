//! Group commit: the one writer that turns many callers' blocks into one
//! durability barrier.
//!
//! # Why there is exactly one writer
//!
//! Durability cost here is not bandwidth, it is *barriers*. A 100k
//! small-file import writes about 5 MB of payload and pays for it with
//! 100,000 `fsync`s, at 3.6-4.8 ms each on the reference host. Hashing and
//! reading can be as parallel as the caller likes; the append order and
//! the barrier cannot, because the whole saving is that N blocks share one
//! barrier. Concentrating appends in one writer is also what structurally
//! removes the append-offset race a multi-writer packed store has to
//! defend against: there is no shared offset to race for.
//!
//! # Leader/follower, not a background thread
//!
//! A submitting caller either finds a commit already in progress -- and
//! waits, its blocks joining the group that commit's successor will take
//! -- or becomes the leader and commits the group itself. No dedicated
//! thread exists, so there is nothing to start, stop, supervise, or
//! schedule, and a store that is idle costs nothing. Batching comes from
//! the physics: while the leader is inside its `fsync`, every other
//! producer's blocks pile up behind it, and the next leader takes all of
//! them.
//!
//! # The three bounds
//!
//! - **blocks** ([`GroupCommitLimits::max_blocks`]) is what binds for tiny
//!   files, where a group is thousands of blocks and a few hundred KiB;
//! - **bytes** ([`GroupCommitLimits::max_bytes`]) is what binds for large
//!   files, where a handful of blocks is already tens of MiB;
//! - **delay** ([`GroupCommitLimits::max_delay`]) bounds how long a leader
//!   will linger for more work before committing what it has.
//!
//! Lingering is *conditional*, and deliberately so: a leader waits only
//! when the previous group actually absorbed more than one caller, i.e.
//! when there is live evidence of concurrent producers. A lone interactive
//! write therefore waits for its own barrier and nothing else, while a
//! saturated import keeps forming full groups. An unconditional linger
//! would tax exactly the workload that cannot benefit from batching.
