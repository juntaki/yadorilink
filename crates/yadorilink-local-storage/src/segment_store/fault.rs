//! A test-only seam for stopping a group commit dead at any one of its
//! ordered boundaries, leaving the on-disk state exactly as a power loss
//! at that instant would.
//!
//! Crash safety here is entirely a property of an *ordering* -- append,
//! fsync the segment, commit the index, only then report durability -- so
//! the only way to test it is to cut the sequence at each boundary and
//! reopen the store. Nothing about that can be observed from the outside
//! after the fact: a store that recovered correctly and a store that never
//! crashed look identical, which is the point.
//!
//! When a fault trips, the commit returns an error **and the store is
//! poisoned**: every later call fails. That is what makes the injection
//! faithful. A real crash does not unwind, does not truncate its own
//! half-written record, and does not get to run another commit -- so
//! neither does this. The test then drops the poisoned handle and opens a
//! fresh store over the same directory, which is exactly what a restart
//! does.
//!
//! Not `#[cfg(test)]`-gated: the crash matrix lives in this crate's
//! `tests/` directory (a separate compilation unit) and other crates'
//! durability-ordering tests reach for the same seam. The cost in a
//! shipping binary is one `Option` check per boundary, against a field
//! nothing ever sets.
