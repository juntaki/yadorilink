//! Measurement-only I/O and pipeline counters for the block store's
//! durability path.
//!
//! Exists for one question: for a large-file capture, `capture ->
//! producer_EOF` is dominated by something that is *not* chunk production
//! (chunking is ~1.8 s per GiB; the phase is ~11.2 s). Wall-clock totals
//! cannot distinguish "the producer is blocked behind durability" from
//! "durability is bandwidth-bound" from "durability is metadata-bound" --
//! and those three have completely different fixes. This module counts
//! calls, bytes and nanoseconds per *operation class* so the breakdown is
//! observed rather than inferred.
//!
//! **Off by default and inert.** Every recording site is guarded by a
//! single `Ordering::Relaxed` load of [`ENABLED`], which nothing in the
//! production binaries ever sets: only the crate's own `examples/` and
//! tests call [`set_enabled`]. When disabled, the cost of an
//! instrumentation site is that one atomic load -- no `Instant::now()`,
//! no atomic increment, no allocation. Nothing here changes control flow,
//! ordering, error handling or durability semantics whether it is on or
//! off.
//!
//! Only counters for the durability path proper live here -- the
//! percentile histogram in particular exists because totals cannot
//! separate "every barrier got slower" from "a few got much slower", and
//! those have different causes and different fixes.
//!
//! No unit tests of the counters live here on purpose: every counter is
//! process-global, and Rust runs a crate's tests in parallel threads of
//! one binary, so a test that armed [`set_enabled`] would both perturb and
//! be perturbed by whatever the store's own tests were committing at that
//! moment. The module's behaviour is exercised end to end by
//! `examples/block_durability_bench.rs` instead, which owns its whole
//! process.
//!
//! Deliberately process-global rather than threaded through the store:
//! the operations being timed sit several layers down inside the segment
//! writer and the persistent index, and the pipeline counters sit inside
//! `chunker.rs`'s scoped background committer. Plumbing a handle to both
//! would have meant changing several production signatures for a
//! diagnostic, which is a worse trade than a global that is switched off.
