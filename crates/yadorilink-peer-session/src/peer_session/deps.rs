/// manually-written `Pin<Box<dyn Future>>`-returning method, not an `async
/// fn`, since this needs to be *dyn*-callable through `Arc<dyn
/// PendingLocalChangeFlush>` — native `async fn` in traits isn't
/// object-safe without this same boilerplate, and this crate has no
/// `async_trait` dependency to hide it behind. Outcome of a targeted
/// local-flush round trip
/// (`PendingLocalChangeFlush::flush_pending_local_change` /
/// `flush_case_fold_sibling`), through this link's debounce-accumulator
/// channel. That channel is small and shared by every concurrent peer
/// message handler reconciling a path against this link — under a
/// duplicate-delivery storm it can back up, so the round trip is bounded
/// rather than awaited unconditionally. `Settled` means the local side is
/// safely accounted for (flushed, or genuinely nothing pending) and the
/// peer change may proceed to native admission. `RetryRequired` means this
/// round trip could not complete its bound (the enqueue or the reply timed
/// out) — the local pending edit's state relative to the incoming peer
/// change is unknown, so admitting the peer change now would risk silently
/// clobbering it; the caller must defer this change instead (it will be
/// re-requested by anti-entropy).
