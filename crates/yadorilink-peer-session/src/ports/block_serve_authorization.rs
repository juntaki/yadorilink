/// - the reference check reads the PUBLISHED view only -- never the raw

/// - the provenance check runs only once the reference check has passed,
///   so the common unreferenced-request case costs one fewer read.
/// - the declared size is read from the LIVE record (`get_file`), not the
///   published one, and only once the request is authorized; it's `None`
///   when the live record is deleted or no longer lists the hash, and the
///   caller falls back to a pessimistic estimate in that case.
