/// it.
///
/// Three lanes write it: the projected-upserts batch, the unbatched
/// eager/pinned content write, and the symlink write.
///
/// `Hydrating`, not `Present`. The row is committed before the bytes are
/// published, deliberately -- that ordering is what lets an intent
/// distinguish a crash mid-write from an offline deletion, and what the
/// local watcher's self-echo suppression depends on. But the window is
/// not brief: a batch writes up to a bounded number of paths, and for the
/// whole of it every row in the batch claimed to hold content that was
/// still in a temp file. `Hydrating` says what is true -- a write for
/// this version is in flight -- and leaves `Present` to the commit that
/// can prove it.

/// hydration, which is asked to place the row it is given. A wire record
/// comes with its own metadata and a native projection derives everything
/// from the resolved version, but these two have to go and read the row
/// -- and both used to read it more than once. The audit read it eight
/// times -- `get_files_by_paths` for the content, then
/// `get_record_kind`, `get_symlink_target`, `get_symlink_out_of_root`,
/// `get_unix_mode`, `get_xattrs` and `get_origin_device_id` one at a time;
/// hydration read the version and then a second column, in two
/// transactions, under a comment claiming it was one. Neither had any
/// isolation spanning its reads. A writer landing in between produced a
/// payload whose content came from one incarnation of the row and whose
/// metadata came from another: a value that was never true of anything, from which
/// a `version_hash` could then be derived that named no version any row
/// had ever held.
