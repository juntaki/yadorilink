//! The one thing local convergence needs a peer for.
//!
//! Convergence work is local: it reads this device's index, writes this
//! device's disk, and proves what it wrote. Three things it cannot do
//! alone -- name the peer a record arrived from, hand an adopted record
//! to that peer session's forwarding channel, and obtain a block this
//! device does not have.
//!
//! That is this module, and it is deliberately the whole crate boundary
//! between a peer session and the convergence executor that runs in
//! `yadorilink-daemon`. Nothing about how a session is implemented
//! appears here: no wire types, no fetch state machine, no measurement
//! plumbing. A fetch reports its outcome and how long it spent on the
//! wire; what the caller does with either is the caller's business.
