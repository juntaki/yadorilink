//! Filename hazard detection: pure detection logic for the three
//! name-based hazards a materialization/
//! hydration write must never proceed past —
//!
//! - a **case-fold collision** with an existing sibling on a
//!   case-insensitive filesystem: two paths that differ only by
//!   case (`Photo.jpg` vs. `photo.jpg`) can coexist in the index (two
//!   peers, or a case-sensitive filesystem, can legally hold both), but
//!   writing both to the same case-insensitive directory clobbers one with
//!   the other.
//! - a **Unicode normalization collision** with an existing sibling on a
//!   filesystem whose name resolution is normalization-insensitive: two
//!   paths that are two different Unicode encodings of the same logical
//!   string (`"\u{e9}.txt"`, composed, vs. `"e\u{301}.txt"`, `e` plus a
//!   combining acute accent, decomposed) are two distinct byte sequences —
//!   and so, like a case-fold collision, can legally coexist in the index —
//!   but a filesystem that resolves both spellings to one on-disk object
//!   clobbers one with the other the same way a case-insensitive one does
//!   for a case-only difference. See [`normalization_collision`]'s doc
//!   comment for which normalization form this compares under and why, and
//!   [`is_normalization_insensitive_filesystem`]'s for how "does this
//!   volume actually alias them" is answered rather than assumed.
//! - a **platform-invalid name**: the documented Windows-
//!   reserved device basenames, a trailing `.`/` `, or any of `<>:"|?*`.
//!
//! Kept in its own module rather than folded into `peer_session.rs` because
//! almost all of it — `invalid_name_reason`, `case_fold_collision`,
//! `normalization_collision` — is pure string/path logic with no
//! `SyncState`/filesystem dependency at all, directly unit-testable on its
//! own. `is_case_insensitive_filesystem` and `is_normalization_insensitive_
//! filesystem` are the two real filesystem probes in this module; see their
//! doc comments.
//!
//! `peer_session::PeerSyncSession::hazard_reason_for` is the only caller:
//! it composes all three checks and turns a hazard into the free-form
//! `held_reason` string `SyncState::set_held` (section 1's schema) records.
//! Per a hazard here **never** produces an automatic rename or
//! escape — the record is held, exactly as-is, under its original path, or
//! not held at all. See `peer_session.rs`'s
//! `no_hazard_ever_writes_under_any_alternate_name` regression test (task
//! 4.5), which the normalization-collision hazard is bound by identically —
//! it reuses the same `held_reason`-only outcome shape as the case-fold
//! hazard rather than introducing a second one (see
//! [`normalization_collision`]'s doc comment for why).

/// what makes NFC the right comparison basis: this function is answering
/// "are these two path strings the same logical name", a property of the
/// two strings alone, not "what byte sequence will this specific volume
/// store them as".
///
/// That is a deliberate, and important, difference from
/// [`is_normalization_insensitive_filesystem`]'s job. This function's
/// answer does not depend on which volume the result will be materialized
/// to; **whether the collision matters** does, which is why the probe is a
/// separate function and this comparison does not attempt to replicate any
/// one filesystem's exact on-disk normalization algorithm. That distinction
/// matters concretely for macOS, whose two shipping filesystems do not
/// agree with each other or with NFC/NFD: HFS+ decomposes every filename it
/// stores using Apple's own canonical-decomposition table, which is close
/// to, but is documented by Apple as *not identical to*, Unicode NFD (a
/// handful of currently-obscure characters decompose differently); APFS by
/// contrast stores whatever bytes were given and instead performs
/// normalization-*insensitive comparison* at lookup time, using yet another
/// internal algorithm neither this crate nor its `unicode-normalization`
/// dependency has an independent implementation of. Reproducing either
/// exactly is not attempted — see [`is_normalization_insensitive_
/// filesystem`]'s doc for why probing the volume for the *effect* (does it
/// alias two spellings that a straightforward NFC/NFD encoder would
/// produce) is the honest substitute for reproducing algorithms this crate
/// cannot independently confirm. What NFC comparison here does guarantee is
/// catching the overwhelmingly common real-world case this hazard exists
/// for: a composed-vs-decomposed spelling of an ordinary accented name,
/// which is canonically equivalent under standard Unicode normalization
/// (and, in every case this crate's own tests can construct, under HFS+'s
/// decomposition too, since Apple's table is a near-superset of NFD's
/// common-Latin coverage) — not a claim that every possible macOS-specific
/// aliasing shape is covered.
///
/// # Held, not auto-resolved — and why
///
/// Exactly like [`case_fold_collision`]: a colliding record is reported
/// (via [`HELD_REASON_NORMALIZATION_COLLISION`], composed by
/// `peer_session::hazard_reason_for_policy`) so the caller can hold it —
/// leave it unmaterialized, under its own original path, exactly as the
/// index already has it — never silently renamed to some disambiguated
/// spelling. The reasoning is identical to the case-fold hazard's, restated
/// here because it is easy to assume Unicode normalization specifically
/// calls for "just normalize it and materialize the normalized form": doing
/// that would mean every peer choosing its own arbitrary normalization
/// convention for materializing an inherited path, which is exactly the
/// kind of automatic-rename-under-a-different-name this module's own doc
/// comment already rules out for every hazard it detects (see the module
/// doc's "the record is held, exactly as-is, under its original path, or
/// not held at all"), and `peer_session.rs`'s `no_hazard_ever_writes_
/// under_any_alternate_name` regression test already pins that invariant
/// for every hazard reported through `hazard_reason_for` — this one
/// included, not exempted. What the user sees is the same as any other
/// held record: it does not appear on disk at this path until the
/// collision is resolved by hand (renaming one of the two paths at the
/// source, which is then a normal, unheld sync), reported through whatever
/// surface already lists held records by `held_reason`.
///
/// # A pair admitted before this check existed
///
/// If both spellings were already accepted into the index before this
/// function existed (nothing rejected either one at admission time; this is
/// purely a materialization-time hold, like [`case_fold_collision`]), this
/// function's first real effect is the next time either path is
/// (re-)materialized on a volume [`is_normalization_insensitive_
/// filesystem`] reports `true` for — exactly the same "next reconcile
/// catches it, nothing retroactively rescans already-held state" answer
/// `peer_session::hazard_reason_for_policy`'s own doc comment already gives
/// for the case-fold hazard, extended here rather than re-derived, since
/// the mechanism (this function is only ever consulted from that same call

/// happens everywhere it's compiled. Where there is no way to tell a
/// remount from the mount that earned the entry on every platform this
/// runs on, the honest answer is not to cache on any of them.

/// What this costs is small relative to its caller. This is the one real

/// the reserved namespace itself: reserved ids are restricted to
/// `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, which cannot express a non-ASCII composed character at
/// all, so a flat normalization probe has no reserved name available to it.

/// decomposed spelling still resolves to the composed one's dentry) even
/// though the two filesystems reach that outcome by different mechanisms,
/// which is exactly why this function measures the observable effect
/// rather than branching on which of the two is mounted. See

/// function's own NFC comparison basis does not attempt to replicate
/// either filesystem's internal algorithm either — the two functions
/// divide the problem the same way [`case_fold_collision`] and
/// [`is_case_insensitive_filesystem`] already do, one deciding "are these
/// two strings the same name" and the other deciding "does this volume
/// care".
///
/// Fails closed exactly like [`is_case_insensitive_filesystem`]: any probe
/// I/O failure conservatively reports `true` (normalization-insensitive),
/// since a missed collision check corrupts user data on the volumes this
/// function got wrong, while an unnecessary extra sibling scan on the
/// volumes it got right costs nothing but a little time — the identical
/// asymmetry that function's own doc comment already argues for, restated
/// here because getting the direction backwards here fails exactly as
