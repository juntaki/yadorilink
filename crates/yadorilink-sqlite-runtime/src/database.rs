// `stats`/`reset`/`record_gate_acquisition` below are a small, permanent
// writer-gate observability primitive. Repository-level tests
// (e.g. `materialization_job_repository`'s `enqueue_pending_writer_gate_
// tests`) rely on `reset()`/`stats()` to assert that a specific operation
// does or does not take the process-wide write lock at all -- a property
// no amount of row-state inspection alone can observe, since a no-op SQL
// UPDATE and a call that never opens a transaction leave identical
// on-disk state.
//
// `call_sites`/`record_call_site`/`call_site_stats` below are permanent
// too; see their own doc comment for why.
//
// `record_gate_hold`/`hold_site_stats` are permanent too, for a reason the
// wait-side counters structurally cannot cover: `record_gate_acquisition`
// times how long a caller WAITED, which by construction never names the
// caller that was holding the gate and made it wait. Every writer-gate
// starvation investigated on this codebase so far has turned on exactly that
// question, and answering it by inference from a wait histogram wasted real
// time twice. Cost is one `Instant::elapsed` and one hash-map update per
// write transaction, inside the gate the caller already holds.
//
// All three key on `(file, line)` borrowed from the caller's own
// `&'static Location`, never on a formatted `String`. They run on every
// write, so an owned key would be a heap allocation per write for a
// counter -- and `record_call_site` in particular is taken BEFORE the
// writer gate rather than under it, so its cost is not absorbed by a lock
// the caller was holding anyway.

/// One half of the fix for a real, previously-diagnosed
/// `SQLITE_LOCKED: database table is locked` failure class.
/// `rusqlite::Connection::transaction` opens a `DEFERRED` transaction by
/// default, which only acquires SQLite's write (`RESERVED`) lock lazily,
/// on the *first write statement actually executed inside it* -- not at
/// `BEGIN` time. A read-then-write first statement inside a transaction
/// (e.g. `UPDATE ... RETURNING`), under this crate's connection pool (many
/// pooled connections concurrently doing independent work), can lose a
/// `SHARED`-to-`RESERVED` lock-upgrade race against another pooled
/// connection's concurrent read -- SQLite's classic deferred-transaction
/// lock-upgrade pitfall. Opening the transaction `IMMEDIATE` instead
/// acquires the `RESERVED` write lock immediately at `BEGIN`, closing that
/// specific upgrade-race window.
///
/// **This alone was not sufficient** -- see `retry_on_database_locked` in
/// `pool.rs` for the other half, and why: `SQLITE_LOCKED` can also arise
/// from SQLite's shared-cache table-locking directly (independent of the
/// deferred-transaction upgrade problem this function closes), which
/// `open_in_memory` deliberately opts into (`cache=shared`, required for
/// pooled connections to see the same in-memory database at all) -- so
/// both mitigations are needed together, not either alone.
