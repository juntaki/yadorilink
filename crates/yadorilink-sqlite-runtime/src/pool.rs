/// The other half of the `SQLITE_LOCKED` fix (see

/// documentation is explicit that `SQLITE_LOCKED` arising from shared-cache
/// table locking (as opposed to schema corruption or a genuinely permanent
/// conflict) is meant to be handled by the *caller* retrying the whole
/// failed transaction after a short wait. Wraps `op` (expected to be a
/// self-contained "check out a connection, open a transaction, do the
/// work, commit" closure -- safe to call more than once, since a failed
/// transaction rolls back and leaves no partial state to retry against)
/// and retries it on `SQLITE_LOCKED`/`SQLITE_BUSY` specifically (via
/// `E::is_locked`), up to a small bounded number of attempts with a short
/// linear backoff. Every other error (any genuine data error) propagates
/// immediately, unretried.
///
/// The backoff blocks the calling thread (`std::thread::sleep`), for up to
/// 225ms across a fully contended call, and this is deliberate on both
/// counts:
///
/// * Blocking, because every entry point into this crate
///   (`SyncDatabase::read`/`write`/`write_immediate`) is synchronous, as
///   are the ~200 repository call sites that reach them. There is no
///   runtime here to yield to -- this crate has no dependency on tokio or
///   any other async runtime, by design, since it is shared by callers
///   that are not async at all.
/// * 225ms, because that worst case only materializes when the lock
///   genuinely stayed held for that long, in which case the alternative to
///   waiting is failing. This window has already been widened once in
///   response to a reproduced convergence gap where real concurrent load
///   pushed `SQLITE_BUSY` straight past it; shortening it trades a bounded
///   wait for an unbounded correctness risk.
///
/// What follows for callers: an async caller must not reach `read`/
/// `write`/`write_immediate` inline on a runtime worker. A worker blocked
/// here is not parked -- it runs no other task at all for the duration,
/// which surfaces as time-to-schedule for everything else sharing that
/// runtime, up to and including this device's own QUIC endpoint driver
/// missing the window to send an ack promptly, provoking the peer's own
/// loss detection into retransmitting a datagram that was never lost.
/// Async callers must wrap these calls in
/// `block_in_place` or `spawn_blocking`, on their own side, where the
/// runtime is actually visible.
