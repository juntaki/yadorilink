//! A fence for a database job that runs on another thread.
//!
//! A task that hands a commit to the blocking pool keeps awaiting it while
//! it still holds everything the commit is about: path locks, root
//! operations, claims. If that task is cancelled mid-job, those guards would
//! be released while the job may still commit on their behalf. A
//! [`JobFence`] closes that: the job holds a [`JobCompletion`] that marks the
//! fence done when it is dropped (the job finished, panicked, or was dropped
//! before it ran), and every party whose guards must outlive the job holds a
//! [`FenceWait`], whose `Drop` blocks until the fence is done.
//!
//! The wait has no timeout: releasing the guards early is unsafe, and
//! elapsed time cannot tell a stuck commit from a slow one, so nothing
//! aborts on it either. While it waits it logs a warning every
//! [`FENCE_WARN_INTERVAL`] with the job's age, phase (queued for the writer
//! gate, or running its commit) and item count, so a wedged filesystem is
//! diagnosable. A wedged commit blocks link stop exactly as an inline commit
//! always did (a blocked thread cannot be aborted); the mitigation is the
//! process supervisor. The one fail-stop is a wait dropped inside a write
//! transaction with a live job: the job may be queued on the gate that thread
//! holds, and not waiting would release guards under it; that is a bug state.
