//! Conflict-copy detail, derived purely from `ConflictedFileInfo.path`'s
//! own established naming convention — never from a new daemon field.
//!
//! `ConflictedFileInfo` on the wire (`daemon_control.proto`) carries only
//! `local_path`/`path`/`size`/`mtime_unix_nanos`: no explicit "which side
//! is current"/"originating device" field. That detail genuinely exists
//! on the wire today, just embedded in the conflicted-copy filename rather
//! than a separate struct field — the sync engine's own conflict-copy
//! naming convention (`yadorilink-replica-domain`'s `conflict.rs`, a
//! sync-engine module this crate does NOT depend on — see this crate's
//! own top doc comment) always produces
//! `<name> (conflicted copy, <ISO-8601-ish timestamp>, <device_id>[,
//! <content hash hex>]).<ext>`, and the CLI's own
//! `commands::version_history` test
//! fixtures encode the identical shape. Parsing that documented, spec-level
//! convention here (rather than adding a sync-engine dependency just to
//! reuse its private stripping helpers) keeps this crate's
//! no-sync-engine-dependency property intact while still surfacing real data, not
//! fabricated fields.
//!
//! Deliberately defensive: an unparseable `path` (a daemon that changed the
//! convention, or an unrelated file that merely landed in the conflicts
//! list) degrades to `None` fields rather than panicking or guessing.
