//! `DeviceSummary` and the cross-group member-list merge (`device_summaries`)
//! — sourced from the coordination plane's per-group member
//! listing (`GET /shares/groups/{id}/members`), never from the account's
//! device registry (`GET /devices` lacks `last_seen` and group scope).
//!
//! Everything here is pure, like `folder.rs`. There is no single "list every
//! device on my account" daemon or coordination-plane call, because
//! membership is inherently per-group, so a cross-folder view needs one
//! member-list fetch per distinct `group_id`. That fetch is the caller's:
//! `distinct_group_ids` names which groups to fetch, the caller fetches each
//! one through its coordination-plane client and projects every member into
//! a `DeviceSummary`, and `device_summaries`/`peer_count`/`peer_counts` derive
//! the view from the results. This crate therefore holds no credential, no
//! HTTP client and no local device identity of its own.
