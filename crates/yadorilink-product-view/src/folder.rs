//! `FolderSummary`/`FolderMode`/`FolderState`/`FolderTransfer` — the

//! `LinkStatus` (`daemon_control.proto`, `StatusResponse.links`).
//!
//! Pure and synchronous: building a `FolderSummary` never blocks on
//! network I/O (the coordination-plane `peer_count`/`device_summaries`
//! calls live in `device.rs` instead, precisely so a folder list can be
//! rendered from a single already-fetched `StatusResponse` without also
//! waiting on the coordination plane per row).

// `DurabilityStatus` gets a rename because
// the wire type's own name (`GroupDurabilityStatus`) reads oddly once it's
// a field on a `Folder`-scoped DTO that already has `full_replica_device_ids`
// next to it; `LocalStorageState`/`FetchAvailability` keep their wire names
// as-is since those already read naturally in UI code.
