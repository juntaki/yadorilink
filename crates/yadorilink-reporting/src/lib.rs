//! Shared report schema, redaction, consent, and queue types for
//! YadoriLink's opt-in OSS usage/error reporting, plus the
//! `local_store` module's plain filesystem-JSON persistence for the
//! consent state and error-candidate store. The optional HTTPS
//! submission client is a separate concern layered on top of
//! `schema::ReportEnvelope`.
//!
//! `schema`, `consent`, `queue`, `redact`, and `builder` deliberately
//! depend on nothing daemon/CLI-specific (no `tokio`, no filesystem
//! access, no clock): every function there is a pure transformation
//! over caller-supplied data, which is what makes the privacy
//! properties in `redact` and `schema::ReportEnvelope::validate`
//! testable in isolation. `local_store` is the one exception among the
//! non-`submission` modules — it does real filesystem I/O — but it has
//! no daemon-specific coupling either, which is why it lives here rather
//! than in `yadorilink-daemon`: both the CLI and the daemon can use it
//! directly. The on-disk submission *queue* and usage *counters* still
//! live in `yadorilink-daemon` (they're entangled with daemon-specific
//! counting and scheduling), reusing `local_store::entry_store` as their
//! storage engine.
//!
//! `submission` is the other exception: it's the optional HTTPS
//! submission client, so it necessarily depends on a
//! minimal-feature `tokio` + `reqwest` for real async I/O — but it's
//! still self-contained, taking only a `&ReportEnvelope` and a plain
//! `Option<&str>` endpoint, with no daemon/CLI/sync/auth types reachable
//! from it.
