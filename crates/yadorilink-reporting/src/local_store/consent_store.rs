//! On-disk persistence for `yadorilink_reporting::ConsentState`. This is
//! also where "local reporting config storage" lives — `ConsentState`
//! already carries `prompt_to_report_enabled` and
//! `endpoint_override`, so one JSON file covers consent *and* the
//! configurable knobs; there's no separate config file.
//!
//! Two invariants this module exists to uphold:
//! - A fresh install must never eagerly write a non-default consent file,
//!   and must never generate an anonymous reporter ID before the user
//!   opts in. `load` returns `ConsentState::default`
//!   without touching disk when no file exists yet; `save` is only ever
//!   called from an explicit mutation method.
//! - The anonymous reporter ID is a fresh random UUID (`new_reporter_id`),
//!   never derived from this device's `device_id` or any coordination-plane
//!   account identifier — this module has no access to either
//!   of those anyway, by construction (`ConsentStore` only ever sees a
//!   directory path).
