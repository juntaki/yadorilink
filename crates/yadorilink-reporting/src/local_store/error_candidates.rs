//! bounded local persistence for error-report *candidates*
//! — severe-error snapshots the daemon captures on its own
//! (section 3.3's job to actually create these from real error hooks;
//! this module only owns the storage) before the user has decided
//! whether to preview, export, submit, or discard them. Lives at
//! `<config_dir>/reporting/error-candidates/`, a separate directory from
//! `queue/` because a candidate hasn't been confirmed by the
//! user yet — it's not "queued for submission," it's "waiting for the
//! user to look at it."
//!
//! Default retention (the exact cap is intentionally left unspecified
//! upstream, so these are this module's own reasoned defaults, not a
//! number pulled from a spec):
//! - `max_entries = 20`: candidates are created automatically by daemon
//!   error hooks with no user action, so the cap needs to be tighter than
//!   the user-confirmed queue's 50 — a crash loop must not fill the disk,
//!   and old unconfirmed candidates are the least valuable data this
//!   crate stores (nobody has even looked at them yet).
//! - `max_age_seconds = 14 days`: half the queue's 30-day default. A
//!   candidate nobody has previewed in two weeks is unlikely to still be
//!   useful context for the user, and clearing it bounds worst-case growth
//!   on a machine that never opts in to reporting at all.
//! - `max_entry_bytes`: reuses `yadorilink_reporting::schema::MAX_REPORT_BYTES`
//!   — candidates are full `ReportEnvelope`s subject to the same overall
//!   size contract as every other report.
//!
//! extension: `create_candidate_with_summary`/`show_with_summary`
//! store/retrieve the `RedactionSummary` produced at candidate-creation
//! time (by `ErrorPayloadBuilder::build`) alongside the
//! entry, as a small sidecar `<id>.redaction.json` file next to the
//! `EntryStore`-managed `<id>.json`. This is deliberately *not* modeled as
//! a change to the shared `EntryStore`/`QueuedReportMetadata` shape (used
//! by the submission queue too, where no such summary exists) — the
//! candidate store already owns its own directory, so a sidecar file next
//! to each entry is a fully additive extension with no risk to
//! `queue.rs`/`entry_store.rs`'s existing contract or tests. Recomputing
//! the summary at preview time instead (by re-running `redact` over the
//! already-stored, already-redacted payload) was rejected: redaction is
//! idempotent by design (see `redact.rs`'s doc comment), so a fresh pass
//! over already-redacted text always finds nothing — that would silently
//! under-report to the user what was actually stripped when the candidate
//! was created.
