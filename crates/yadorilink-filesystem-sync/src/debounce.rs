//! Coalesces raw filesystem events into windowed batches before they reach
//! `LocalChangeProcessor` (`yadorilink-local-capture::local_change`).
//! Deliberately knows nothing about indexing, chunking, or peers — it only
//! decides *when* a set of paths should be considered "one batch," leaving
//! the caller (typically `yadorilink-daemon::link_runtime`) to turn that
//! batch into actual work via a separate executor task, so this module
//! owns none of that I/O and stays cheaply unit-testable in isolation.
//! Lives here, not in `yadorilink-daemon`, despite being task-scheduling-
//! shaped rather than filesystem-execution-shaped: `DebounceFlush` (this
//! module's output type) is consumed directly by
//! `yadorilink-local-capture::local_change::process_flush` in production,
//! and `yadorilink-local-capture` sits *below* `yadorilink-daemon` in the
//! dependency graph (`yadorilink-daemon` depends on it, never the reverse)
//! — moving this module to `yadorilink-daemon` would need
//! `yadorilink-local-capture` to depend back on `yadorilink-daemon`, a
//! real cycle. `yadorilink-filesystem-sync` already owns this module's one
//! real dependency (`watcher::{FsChangeEvent, FsChangeKind}`) and already
//! sits below both `yadorilink-local-capture` and `yadorilink-daemon`, so
//! it is the natural common ancestor for a type both need.

/// answer trustworthy. The `select!` above is `biased` with the flush-request
/// branch ahead of `events.recv()` — deliberately, so a targeted flush is
/// never stuck behind an unrelated burst — but that priority also means a
/// local write whose event is sitting *unread* in `events` is invisible to
/// the request, which then replies "nothing pending for that path".
///
/// The caller of that reply is
/// `PeerSyncSession::flush_pending_local_change_before_reconcile`, whose
/// entire job is to capture a local edit before an incoming remote change
/// is admitted and materialized over it. A false "nothing pending" there is
/// silent data loss, not a delay: the remote content overwrites the local
/// write on disk, and when the event finally is dequeued, `process_flush`
/// re-reads the path, finds the remote bytes already matching the index,
/// suppresses it as a self-echo, and the local write is never authored at
/// all. Measured as exactly this, on `dst_network_fault_chaos` seeds
/// 3298840576/3298840578: every lost write was on the device driven through
/// the watcher/debounce path, and its round printed no flush line.
///
/// Scope, measured rather than assumed: draining here removes *one* window
/// — the event is in this channel but not yet polled — and no more. It is
/// **not** on its own sufficient to close the loss. With this drain in
/// place and the disk-authoritative fallback disabled, that scenario still
/// failed 1 run in 3, because a false-negative `None` is also reachable
/// when the entry was already dispatched to the executor and its
/// `process_flush` simply has not run yet. Nothing this accumulator can do
/// covers that case: the only reliable defense is the caller's
/// `link_manager::LinkFlushHandle::capture_undiscovered_local_change`
/// fallback, which reads the path off disk before the incoming change is
/// admitted, and which is what actually makes the scenario green.
///
/// This drain still earns its place — `flush_case_fold_sibling` has no
/// such fallback by deliberate design (see its doc comment), so for that
/// caller the accumulator's reply *is* the whole answer, and a stale one
/// is the artifact-free silent overwrite it exists to prevent.
