//! Reconciles the disk under held paths: removes stale bytes,
//! preserves what it cannot account for, leaves the path empty for the row's
//! projection, and releases the hold.
//!
//! A path is held when its object on disk belongs to no row this device
//! placed (a local edit native could not author there). While
//! a path is held nothing captures it and nothing projects it; this pass is
//! its one writer. See `yadorilink_sync_sqlite::held_path` for
//! the hold itself.
//!
//! Each step is idempotent against the state a crash can leave between
//! any two of them, because every decision is made from what is on disk
//! now:
//!
//! - stale bytes are first renamed to a reserved preimage name beside the
//!   path, and only removed once the object renamed is confirmed to be
//!   them; a preimage found at the start of a pass is settled the same way
//!   before anything else;
//! - after removing stale bytes or moving divergent ones aside, the path
//!   is empty, which reads as [`DiskVerdict::Absent`] on the next pass;
//! - the hold is released last, in one transaction, so a crash before it
//!   leaves the path held and the next pass finishes it.
//!
//! Nothing locks a user out of a held path, so no step acts on what an
//! earlier one saw there: the object a removal takes is re-examined after
//! it is taken, and a path is only released while it is still empty. A user
//! write that lands in between is preserved as a conflict copy, or left where
//! it is for the next pass.
//!
//! Directories follow the namespace the rows describe (a file whose name a
//! live row below needs has already been moved to its copy name, so the
//! rows are the namespace's shape):
//!
//! - a Directory row is placed through the Directory lane: a
//!   real directory with the row's mode, and its proof;
//! - a path only live rows below need becomes a structural directory,
//!   created through the recording `mkdir` helper, or adopted as
//!   structural when it is the held row's explicit directory;
//! - a directory nothing needs any more is removed only when this device
//!   made it (the held row's directory, or a structural one) and it is
//!   empty, with one non-recursive `rmdir`; one that still holds content
//!   this device does not replicate is kept and recorded as retained (D4),
//!   and a directory the user made is never touched. Structural ancestors
//!   of a dropped path go with it the same way.
