//! Local filesystem change detection, watching a linked folder
//! for create/modify/delete/rename events without requiring a manual scan
//! trigger (`sync-engine` spec's "Local Change Detection" requirement).
//!
//! `notify`'s `RecommendedWatcher::watch`/`unwatch` must never be called
//! synchronously from within the watcher's own event-callback closure.
//! Every one of `notify` 8.2's backends (verified directly against its
//! vendored source, not assumed) funnels callback delivery and
//! watch-registration requests through the *same single dedicated event-
//! loop thread*: macOS FSEvents delivers callbacks on a `CFRunLoop` thread
//! and `watch`'s `stop` step busy-waits for that exact thread to go
//! idle before reconfiguring; Linux inotify and Windows
//! `ReadDirectoryChangesW` both process a `watch` call as a message sent
//! to that same event-loop thread, then block the caller on a reply that
//! only that thread can send. Calling `watch` reentrantly from inside
//! the callback therefore blocks the one thread the backend needs in order
//! to ever unblock it — an indefinite deadlock on every backend, not an
//! FSEvents-specific quirk. See `spawn_new_directory_registrar` below,
//! which hands new-directory registration off to a tokio task instead.
//!
//! On macOS the gap described next is closed by never registering a watch
//! after startup: the root is watched once, recursively (see
//! [`RootWatch`]), and a new directory only has its contents re-reported.
//! The per-directory registration below is what inotify and
//! `ReadDirectoryChangesW` use, where adding a watch leaves the others
//! alone.
//!
//! Moving `watch` off the callback thread closed that deadlock, but not a
//! residual gap — confirmed directly against `notify` 8.2.0's vendored
//! FSEvents source (`fsevent.rs`): `watch_inner`/`unwatch_inner` always
//! call `stop` (tear down the *entire* `FSEventStream` and block until
//! its dedicated thread joins) followed by `run` (a brand-new
//! `FSEventStreamCreate`, covering every currently-watched path, not just
//! the one being added/removed). `since_when` is fixed to
//! `kFSEventStreamEventIdSinceNow` once, at `FsEventWatcher` construction,
//! and is never advanced to the last-delivered event ID on a restart — so
//! the recreated stream genuinely starts "since now" at whatever moment
//! `FSEventStreamCreate` happens to run. Any real filesystem event for
//! *any* watched path (not only the newly-registered one) that lands in
//! the gap between the old stream stopping and the new one starting is
//! never delivered by the OS at all: not delayed, not coalesced, not
//! recoverable by anything watching the callback — confirmed empirically
//! too (raw `notify::Event`-level instrumentation during a 100%-
//! reproducible failure showed zero trace of the lost event ever reaching
//! the callback). Every `register_new_directory_tree` call is a `watch`
//! call, so it always opens this window. Since this is an OS-level
//! delivery gap this codebase's own code cannot observe or narrow (there
//! is nothing to lock more tightly — `notify` itself never sees the
//! event, so which specific path, if any, was affected is unknowable from
//! here), the fix in `spawn_new_directory_registrar` below is a
//! reconciling safety net rather than a targeted capture: every
//! registration trigger re-scans from `root` (not just the specific
//! directory that triggered it) for any directory not yet in
//! `watched_dirs`, registering and reconciling each one found this way —
//! this is how a lost rename's *destination* directory (never reported by
//! the callback as "new" at all) still gets discovered and its contents
//! indexed. This scan is purely path-level (which directories exist and
//! are/aren't already watched) and never touches file content or the
//! index — deliberately not implemented by reusing the watcher-channel-
//! overflow/`DebounceFlush::RescanRequired` full index-vs-disk
//! reconciliation, which was tried first and found unsafe: triggering a
//! full `scan_existing_files_with_ignore` this often can re-derive and
//! re-version a file that's concurrently mid-conflict-resolution between
//! two devices, permanently stalling convergence (reproduced
//! deterministically — see `spawn_new_directory_registrar`'s doc comment
//! for the full account).
