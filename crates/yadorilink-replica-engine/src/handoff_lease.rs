//! Pure decision layer for `yadorilink-sync-core`'s handoff-lease pin
//! deadline, extracted 7D-9D.
//!
//! # Why only this narrow slice lives here
//!
//! The full handoff-lease repository
//! (`crates/yadorilink-sync-sqlite/src/handoff_lease.rs`) is a
//! `handoff_leases`-table-backed CRUD/query store: every method takes a live
//! `SyncDatabase` connection and stays in `yadorilink-sync-sqlite` per the
//! dependency plan. What moves here is the one piece of that store with no
//! SQL and no connection in it at all: turning a lease grant's `ttl_seconds`
//! duration into this device's own LOCAL pin deadline. Splitting it out
//! makes that arithmetic (and, more importantly, the TTL validation guarding
//! it) independently unit-testable with no database, matching the same
//! pattern `retained_obligation.rs`'s split used for its own deletion
//! judgment.

/// Worker's own view of the lease under any realistic clock skew between the
/// two: pinning a little too long only delays this device's own next
/// retention sweep by that much, while pinning even slightly too short can
/// let a retention sweep collect a version the handoff still depends on. The
/// safe direction is always longer, never shorter.

/// record_handoff_lease_atomic`) stores the result as
/// `handoff_leases.expires_at_unix` and later compares it only against this

///
/// A non-positive TTL cannot produce a safe pin: it yields a deadline at or
/// before `created_at_unix`, so the pin would lapse immediately and reopen
/// the retention/GC race this lease exists to close. Reject it structurally
/// here — fail closed, before any row is ever written — so an invalid
/// duration (e.g. a malformed grant that slipped past the caller's own
/// boundary check) can never produce a too-short pin. The safety margin only
/// ever lengthens a positive TTL; it must not be relied on to rescue a
/// non-positive one.
