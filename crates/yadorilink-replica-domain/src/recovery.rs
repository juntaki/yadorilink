//! Recovery-inventory domain identity: which local recovery journal a
//! decoded (or undecoded) row belongs to. Moved down from
//! `yadorilink-sync-core::recovery` (Phase 7D-9F) so it can be referenced
//! from `yadorilink-sync-sqlite`'s own repository implementations without
//! creating a `sync-sqlite -> sync-core` dependency cycle -- the production
//! dependency direction is `sync-core -> sync-sqlite`, so a type only
//! `sync-core` owned could never be named from `sync-sqlite`'s own inherent
//! methods. Pure data with no SQL/database/`SyncState` coupling of its own;
//! `yadorilink-sync-core::recovery` keeps the business-logic layer (severity
//! classification, `RecoveryOperationSummary`, the read-only inventory
//! assembly) that is genuinely coupled to `SyncState` and stays behind.
