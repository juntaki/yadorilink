//! `NativeAuthorFrontier`: authenticated sync/equivocation metadata for the
//! native causal state — kept as its own first-class domain type, **not**
//! folded into [`crate::native_state::NativeState`].
//!
//! Product decision (2026-09-28): a tip header hash is signed-delta-chain /
//! equivocation-detection / sync-frontier metadata, not semantic head
//! state. `NativeState.context` stays exactly `AuthorId -> AuthorSeq` — the
//! minimal causal-semantics state — and never grows a tip field.
//! `NativeAuthorFrontier` is the separate, authenticated record of each
//! author's chain position **and** the header hash of the delta that
//! attained it.
//!
//! **Invariant callers must maintain, never this module alone:**
//! `state.context[author] == frontier[author].seq` for every author present
//! in either, checked at every transaction boundary that installs both
//! together (`yadorilink-sync-sqlite::native_store::install_verified_delta`).
//! A tip is only ever advanced by a *verified* `NativeDelta` or a *verified*
//! `NativeCheckpoint` — never guessed, never a placeholder — so this module
//! exposes no way to construct a `NativeAuthorFrontierEntry` other than by
//! naming its fields directly from already-verified material.
