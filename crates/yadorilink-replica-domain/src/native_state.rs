//! Native causal state: per-path live heads as the primary source of
//! truth, with no change log, no ancestry graph, no basis admission and no base.
//!
//! A replica keeps, and only keeps:
//!
//! * `context`: per author, the highest sequence number it has observed
//!   (gap-free by construction under the honest-author model);
//! * `heads`: per path, the live heads, each identified by its dot
//!   `(author, seq)` and carrying its payload (content version, provenance).
//!
//! A local mutation issues exactly one dot and edits any number of paths
//! through the single [`NativeState::author`] primitive; [`join`] keeps a
//! head of one side when the other side holds it too or has not observed
//! its dot yet. Deleted heads are forgotten; the memory of a deletion is
//! the context alone.
//!
//! The winner order implemented here is documented on [`win_key`] and
//! [`resolve_winner`].
//!
//! Scope: honest authors. An author computes each mutation against its own
//! current state, never issues two payloads for one dot and never claims
//! context it has not observed. Transport may delay, duplicate, reorder and
//! partition. Nothing here authenticates a remote state; that is
//! [`crate::local_op`]'s and a future `SignedDelta`'s job.

// A fork carries both payloads (with their provenance) as evidence; errors
// are rare, so their size does not matter here.
