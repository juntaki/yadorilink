//! The capture-level intent vocabulary: the `Op`s a local scan or event
//! produces (`Put`, `Delete`, `Move`) and the size limits of an op list.
//!
//! An `Op` is intent, not replicated state. `Move` is a rename hint that a
//! native delta cannot express (a delta carries one op per path), so it exists
//! only on the capture side, where it is lowered to a remove at the source
//! plus a put at the destination. The canonical encoding below only sizes
//! and orders op lists; it is not a wire format.
