/// **`roots_digest` covers the full durability-root set — current plus

/// retain different history and go on doing so indefinitely:
///
/// * a device that links a group it did not originate starts from a local
///   history floor, and never reconstructs versions from before it;
/// * retention expiry keeps a version while it is within *either* the
///   count bound or the age bound, so a version inside the count bound is
///   retained forever no matter how old it gets — a device holding one
///   extra historical version of an untouched file keeps it permanently;
/// * `version_seq` is device-local, expiry runs on each device's own
///   clock, and each device's outstanding handoff leases pin different
///   rows.
///
/// Requiring `roots_digest` equality would therefore have made the common
/// two-device topology — one device joins a folder another already had —
/// permanently uncorroborated. It is carried as an *observation*: when it
/// does match, more is true, and that is worth recording and reporting.
/// The handoff proof still covers the whole root set, at the moment it
/// matters.
///
/// `unmaterialized_current_count` is what stops the comparison from being
/// vacuous. A `files` row exists as soon as its change is projected, long
/// before the content behind it has been fetched — so a peer that has
/// caught up on the DAG and downloaded nothing at all has an identical
/// `current_digest`. Without this count, a second device that joined a
/// minute ago and is still transferring would corroborate instantly, and
/// the group would report itself protected while exactly one device held
/// the data.
///
/// It is a **working-tree fact standing in for a block-store one**, and
/// that substitution is deliberate. Durability is about whether a peer's
/// block store holds the bytes; materialization is about whether that peer
/// has written them out into its folder. For an eager replica the second
/// implies the first, so this is sufficient — and it is not necessary: a
/// peer mid-hydration holds every block and still reports rows
/// unmaterialized, and will not be corroborated until it finishes.
///
/// That error direction is the reason for the choice. A false negative here
/// costs a transient `Unknown` on a group that is, accurately, still being
/// taken custody of. The alternative — asking the block store directly
/// whether it holds every current root's blocks — answers the exact
/// question, but its answer changes without any `files` write, so
/// [`Self::generation`] would not invalidate a memo of it and a stale hit
/// would be a false *positive*. That is the one direction this whole design
/// exists to exclude, and buying precision with it is not a trade worth
/// making for a health indicator.
///
/// Even with it, this remains an index-level claim the peer makes about
