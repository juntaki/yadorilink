//! `AuthorizationEvidence` — the sole publication authority for a
//! `Change`.
//! Pure, dependency-neutral (no storage, no network, no async): this is
//! the ONE canonical Rust implementation of checkpoint construction and
//! verification, used identically by local checkpoint flush (daemon-side
//! authoring), peer receive (verifying a `PublishedChange` carried in a
//! `ChangeBatch`), rebootstrap witness verification, and tests. Moved
//! here from `yadorilink-daemon` because none of this depends on the
//! daemon's storage or runtime — only `yadorilink_daemon::change_policy`'s
//! `GroupPolicyState::resolve_authority_key` (supplied to
//! [`verify_change_admission`] as a plain closure) ties a verification
//! into one specific device's verified policy chain.
//!
//! - A device can create Changes fully offline, any time. Locally these
//!   are `Pending` — not yet globally admissible, not yet synced to any
//!   other device.
//! - Publishing them requires reconnecting and asking the coordination
//!   plane to sign a Merkle root over a batch of pending Changes. The
//!   authority checks "is this device CURRENTLY a writer" **at that
//!   moment**, live, and only signs if so. If the device was revoked
//!   before asking, the authority refuses, full stop — no window, no
//!   timestamp, nothing for the device to forge.
//! - The resulting [`AuthorizationCheckpoint`] plus a [`MerkleProof`] for
//!   one specific Change, TOGETHER WITH the author's raw Ed25519 public
//!   key, is what any receiver verifies, fully offline, with no live
//!   connection to the authority, no notion of who delivered the bytes,
//!   and — critically — no dependency on the author still being present
//!   in the receiver's live netmap. A fresh device, or one that only
//!   later joins a group, must be able to verify history from an author
//!   who has since been revoked and forgotten; carrying the raw key in
//!   the proof (rather than requiring the verifier to already have it
//!   pinned) is what makes that possible. See [`verify_change_admission`]
//!   for exactly how that raw key is bound to the checkpoint rather than
//!   independently trusted.
//!
//! **This authorizes at PUBLISH time, not at edit time.** A Change made
//! while offline, during a period the author was later revoked and then
//! re-granted before reconnecting, is admissible once checkpointed —
//! `verify_change_admission` has no way to know or care when a Change was
//! authored, only that it is covered by a checkpoint issued while the
//! author was CURRENTLY a writer. This is not a loophole; it is what
//! follows from refusing to trust any self-reported time. User-facing
//! copy must say "offline editing always works; whether an unpublished
//! edit can reach other devices is decided by your CURRENT write
//! permission at publish time" — never "...decided by your permission
//! when you made the edit," which this design does not provide and
//! should not claim to.
//!
//! The crucial structural property: there is no client-supplied timestamp
//! anywhere in [`verify_change_admission`]. The only things trusted are
//! (a) the authority's Ed25519 signature over the checkpoint (verified
//! under the key that was actually the group's authority key AT
//! `policy_head`, resolved through the caller's own verified policy
//! chain), (b) a Merkle inclusion proof binding one Change's hash to the
//! checkpoint's `merkle_root`, with the checkpoint also committing to the
//! batch's exact `leaf_count` so the proof can't be reinterpreted against
//! a differently-shaped batch that happens to hash to the same root, and
//! (c) the carried author public key hashing to the checkpoint's own
//! `signing_key_fingerprint` — the authority signature already commits to
//! that fingerprint, so the raw key itself needs no independent trust, it
//! only needs to match what the authority actually vouched for. A device
//! cannot manufacture a checkpoint covering a Change the authority never
//! saw while it was still a writer, because the device does not hold the
//! authority's signing key. This is what makes "revocation is immediate"
//! true again: immediate for everything not yet checkpointed, at the one
//! moment that actually matters (checkpoint issuance), rather than
//! approximated by a TTL or a relay's serve-time opinion.
//!
//! One Changes-to-Merkle-root batching means the authority signs once per
//! reconnect/flush, not once per Change. The issuance endpoint MUST
//! linearize checkpoint issuance against revocation (a checkpoint and a
//! revoke for the same device never both commit as if the other had not
//! happened); this module cannot enforce that server-side contract, only
//! what an already-issued checkpoint can be trusted to mean.
//! `signer_key_id` binds each checkpoint to the authority key it was
//! signed under, so authority-key rotation stays verifiable.
//!
//! Carrier/transport identity plays no role anywhere in this file: there
//! is no notion of "who delivered this" in any function signature here,
//! by construction — `Accept(change, direct) == Accept(change, relay) ==
//! Accept(change, TURN)` follows directly from that absence.

/// Fully offline verification that `change_hash`, authored by
/// `author_device_id` using `author_signing_public_key`, is admissible
/// for `expected_group_id` — because it is covered by a validly-signed
/// [`AuthorizationCheckpoint`].
///
/// `author_signing_public_key` is the RAW key carried alongside the proof
/// (e.g. in a `ChangeBatch`'s `AuthorizationCheckpointEnvelope`), not a
/// value looked up from the verifier's own local key-pin store — a fresh
/// device that has never seen `author_device_id` in its live netmap must
/// still be able to verify this. That raw key is not independently
/// trusted, though: it is bound to the checkpoint by requiring
/// `fingerprint_signing_key(author_signing_public_key)` to equal
/// `checkpoint.signing_key_fingerprint`, and the checkpoint's own
/// signature (verified below) is what actually vouches for that
/// fingerprint. This function does NOT verify the Change's own signature
/// against `author_signing_public_key` — that is
/// `yadorilink_replica_domain::change::Change::verify_signature`'s job;
/// callers must call both, in either order, before treating a
/// remotely-received Change as admissible (see that crate's receive-path
/// caller for the required order and why signature verification and
/// checkpoint/proof verification are kept as two separate, independently
/// testable steps rather than merged into one).
///
/// `resolve_authority_key(signer_key_id, policy_head)` is supplied by the
/// caller, backed by that caller's own already-verified policy chain
/// (`yadorilink_daemon::change_policy::GroupPolicyState`) — it must
/// return the authority key that chain considers valid for
/// `signer_key_id` AT `policy_head`, or `None` if no such binding exists
/// (unknown key, or a key that had already been rotated out by that
/// point). This function never accepts a bare "trust this key" parameter
/// for exactly the reason a `PolicyRecord` signed by a stale authority
/// key is rejected elsewhere in this codebase: which key is currently
/// authoritative is a question only the verified policy chain can answer.
///
/// No parameter here is a timestamp the caller controls and this function
/// trusts, and no parameter here identifies a transport/carrier — this is
/// what makes carrier choice provably irrelevant to acceptance.
// Every parameter is an independent input to the acceptance decision, and
// the doc comment above reasons about each one's presence individually --
// specifically that none of them is a caller-controlled timestamp and none
// identifies a carrier. Bundling them into a struct would hide exactly the
// per-parameter argument that makes carrier choice provably irrelevant.
