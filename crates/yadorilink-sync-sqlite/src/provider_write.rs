//! The provider write path's transaction: one apply-change request keyed by item,
//! decided and committed in ONE immediate write transaction together with its operation record.
//!
//! What the transaction guarantees:
//!
//! * a replay of an operation returns the stored result and authors nothing; an operation whose
//!   result expired but whose identity is still marked processed is STALE, never a new change;
//! * every check that decides the outcome (the item, the base, name collisions of the folded
//!   name and the whole destination subtree, the delete bound) is made inside the transaction
//!   that writes, so nothing slips in between;
//! * an edit is authored against the version the user SAW (`BaseVersion`), not the row as it
//!   stands: a base the daemon does not know is an opaque stale base that supersedes no heads;
//!   an edit that is not provably made from the current version never changes it: its bytes are
//!   kept durably as a conflict-named file (an operation that carries bytes is never refused
//!   without keeping them);
//! * nothing is ever replaced: a name that is taken is a collision. A recursive directory delete is
//!   `rm -r` on the current directory identity (its own echoed token must be current) and deletes
//!   the subtree as it is at execution time; unseen descendants are not a refusal reason. A file
//!   delete destroys only an unambiguous view. A destination folder is an identity, not a view;
//! * no presence evidence is recorded here: what the OS holds is learned only from the ordinary
//!   handoff and membership route.
