//! Remote admission of one `NativeDelta` -- the context-gated
//! algorithm: [`admit_native_delta`] runs
//! every write its verdict causes in the caller's own transaction (pass
//! `&tx`, exactly as every other function in this crate documents), and a
//! held delta's signed bytes are the only thing persisted for it — nothing
//! reaches `native_author_context`/`native_heads`/`native_author_frontier`
//! until it is actually admitted.
//!
//! Two gates run before a delta's ops ever touch [`NativeState`]:
//!
//! 1. **Chain continuity** ([`native_frontier::classify_chain_advance`]):
//!    is this delta exactly its own author's next seq?
//! 2. **Op-level context gate** (this module): does every dot a removal
//!    names belong to an author this replica has observed at least that
//!    far? A dot it has observed but no longer holds live (superseded by
//!    a different provenance, or already removed) is *not* what this gate
//!    holds on — that is [`NativeState::receive_verified`]'s best-effort
//!    no-op case, applied only once both gates pass.
//!
//! Either gate can hold the delta; holding persists its wire bytes,
//! keyed by the one dot it is missing, and releases (recursively retries)
//! every held delta waiting on a dot the moment that dot is actually
//! admitted. Held deltas are persisted rows (`native_delta_holds`), a
//! hold queue built for native's chain-and-context admission shape.
