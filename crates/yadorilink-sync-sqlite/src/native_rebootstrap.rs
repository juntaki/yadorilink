//! Rebootstrap, up to and including the preserved durability barrier.
//!
//! A replica whose history is behind what its peers retain cannot catch up by
//! deltas. It installs a verified checkpoint of a peer, the target, but the
//! target does not contain every change this replica made: an own delta the
//! target's frontier does not cover would be lost. This module decides which
//! target to take, saves what the target would lose, and makes both durable
//! before anything is destroyed. It changes neither the sync root nor the native
//! state; installing the target is a later stage that starts from the
//! [`Preserved`] barrier reached here.
//!
//! What is saved is the whole uncovered own delta sequence, of every incarnation
//! of this device and whether or not a delta was ever published: the exact signed
//! bytes, the file version each put names, and the order in which they must be
//! replayed. It goes to a recovery area ([`crate::native_rebootstrap_recovery`])
//! from which it can be recovered with no database and no sync root, together
//! with the exact target bundle and what is needed to verify that bundle again
//! with no peer and no authority ([`crate::native_rebootstrap_target`]).
//!
//! The journal tables here are progress bookkeeping only. Before the barrier the
//! old state is wholly authoritative: a crash discards the half-written area.
//! After it, the manifest is the recovery basis.
