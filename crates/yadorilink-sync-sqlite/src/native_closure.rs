//! Closing an author-incarnation: the verified, self-signed closures and what
//! they gate.
//!
//! An incarnation that was rotated away from is closed at a cutoff: deltas of it
//! at or below the cutoff are still admitted (a replica that is behind needs
//! them, and an exact re-delivery is a duplicate), deltas above it never are.
//! `None` closes the incarnation before its first delta.
//!
//! There is one record of a closure, [`native_author_closure`]: the closure the
//! closed device signed, with its signature, key and authorization, so every row
//! is a self-contained proof that verifies again on its own. The row is
//!
//! * the evidence that a closure exists and verified,
//! * the admission cutoff, the moment it is stored, whether or not the replica
//!   can install it as the author's state (see [`effective_closed_cutoff`]),
//! * the material a [`ClosureOutcome::Fork`] is detected from,
//! * the input [`needs_rebootstrap`] derives from, and
//! * the backing of an installed `Closed` author state: an author is `Closed`
//!   only while a verified closure with exactly its cutoff is held.
//!
//! Rows are outside every root, digest and projection, and a rebootstrap install
//! never clears them. A closure leaves the device only inside a bundle whose
//! replacement checkpoint carries the semantics the old incarnation had not yet
//! published: a row holds the hash of that checkpoint in
//! `replacement_checkpoint_hash`, and [`closures_for_export`] reads only rows
//! that have one. A closure received inside a bundle is stored in the
//! transaction that accepts the bundle, never before.
//!
//! The installed state lives in `native_closed_authors`, which a checkpoint
//! commits through the author-state root.
