//! Native bootstrap: a complete current native state, checkpointed by a
//! sealer, that a fresh replica verifies and installs on its own.
//!
//! A checkpoint is a bootstrap snapshot, not a compaction: what a
//! new device, a new member or a replica with a lost database installs before
//! it applies the deltas that follow. The payload carries:
//!
//! * the sealer-signed [`NativeCheckpoint`] (namespace root and author-state
//!   root);
//! * every live head as `(path, dot, provenance)`, each with the signed delta
//!   that produced it and that delta's publication evidence. The namespace root
//!   commits only provenance hashes, so it cannot by itself attest a head's
//!   version; the delta does, and the receiver re-derives it from it;
//! * every author's state (open at its frontier entry, or closed at a cutoff) so
//!   later deltas chain onto it;
//! * the content versions, and the projection state (kept copies and stable
//!   names; placements are derived by the receiver, and a reconciliation hold
//!   is never carried). Index rows are not carried: the receiver rebuilds its
//!   own from the heads.
//!
//! The receiver reconstructs the state, recomputes the two roots and refuses
//! the payload unless they equal the checkpoint's. Installation is one
//! transaction (`install_checkpoint` replaces the whole group's state: a rare
//! path, linear in the group, not a per-delta one) and arms every changed path
//! for materialization.
