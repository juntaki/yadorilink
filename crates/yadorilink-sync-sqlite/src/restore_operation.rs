//! `RestoreOperationRepository` owns the `restore_operations` table -- the
//! crash-safe journal of a restore whose replacement file and index update
//! have not both been durably committed yet.
//! `record_restore_operation_emitting_change` (`restore_operations` + native
//! delta authoring) and `commit_restore_operation` (`restore_operations` +
//! `files` + native state) are two of the ownership doc's "Known
//! cross-cluster atomic operations" -- reaching directly into `dag_store`
//! free functions and raw `files`-table SQL inside their own transaction,
//! exactly as
//! [`crate::handoff_lease::HandoffLeaseRepository::record_handoff_lease_atomic`]
//! already reaches into `files` for its own atomic pin. Decomposing either
//! into separate repository calls would reopen the crash window the single
//! transaction exists to close.
