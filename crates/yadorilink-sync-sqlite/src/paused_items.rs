//! `PausedItemRepository` owns `paused_items`: the files and folders a user
//! paused from the shell context menu, per linked group.
//!
//! Pausing an item holds exactly two things for every path it covers, and
//! nothing else:
//!
//! - local emission: a local edit is not turned into a change, so no peer
//!   can be served it (local capture consults [`PausedItemRepository::list`]);
//! - remote projection: a remote change is still admitted and stored, and
//!   its projection obligation still opens, but the projection scheduler
//!   does not claim it ([`crate::projection_obligations::claim_runnable_obligations`]).
//!
//! Nothing is dropped while paused, so resume only has to release the hold:
//! the local edits are still on disk, and the remote changes are still
//! pending obligations. The pause itself is durable -- "paused until
//! resumed" must survive a daemon restart -- which is why it is a table and
//! not process memory.
//!
//! An item covers its own path and, for a folder, every path beneath it.
//! The empty path is the linked folder's root and covers the whole group.
//! [`path_is_covered`] is the one Rust statement of that rule;
//! [`COVERED_BY_PAUSED_ITEM_SQL`] is the same rule for the claim query, and
//! the tests below pin the two to each other.
