//! The evidence and settlement of brand-new paths, from what authoring already holds.
//!
//! After a capture authors a put at a path nothing else named, the commit publishes the proof of
//! what it observed on disk and tries to close the path's obligation against it. For such a path
//! every fact that takes is in hand from the transaction's own writes: the install returned the
//! heads it left at the path, the arming returned the obligation it left, and the version the head
//! names is the one being committed. This module publishes the proofs of a chunk of such paths in
//! batches (one statement per chunk for the fences, for the proofs and for the closes) from those
//! facts, instead of reading each back per path.
//!
//! The facts a head set alone cannot give are absent here by the caller's check (see
//! [`open_namespace_paths`] and [`crate::new_path_rows::brand_new_paths`]): no head at an ancestor
//! or a descendant, and nothing recording a placement, stable name or kept copy for the path. A
//! path for which any of that is not known to hold takes the per-path settlement, which reads it.
