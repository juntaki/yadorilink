//! The one destructive transition of a group's native state.
//!
//! [`install_checkpoint`] clears the group's native state and installs a verified
//! checkpoint bundle in its place. Nothing else in the crate replaces or clears a
//! group's state: a device that joins a group for the first time and a device that
//! rebootstraps both call it, the first on state that is empty (the clear has
//! nothing to delete), the second behind the preserved barrier.
//!
//! The install never merges. A checkpoint is not joined into state that is there:
//! anything the replica holds that the target does not cover has been set aside by
//! the rebootstrap barrier before this runs, so there is nothing to reconcile and
//! nothing the install could silently drop.
//!
//! In order, all in the caller's transaction:
//!
//! 1. the kind is checked: a fresh install needs empty state; a rebootstrap needs
//!    the marker of its own recovery id, a journal in `Quarantining`, and the
//!    barrier exactly as it was recorded (the frozen frontier and the recovery
//!    items), read again here, immediately before the clear;
//! 2. the target is checked against the closures this replica already holds;
//! 3. the group's native state is cleared;
//! 4. the target is installed, with the closures it carries stored bound to its
//!    checkpoint;
//! 5. the projection is armed for every path whose heads changed;
//! 6. a rebootstrap rotates this device to a new incarnation and closes the old
//!    ones.
//!
//! An `Err` leaves the transaction to be dropped: nothing is committed by this
//! function, and nothing is recorded by a refusal.
