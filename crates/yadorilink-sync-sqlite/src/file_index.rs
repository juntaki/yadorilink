///
/// sync-performance: `upsert_file_with_origin` is the hot path for every

/// SQLite round trips, not the more obvious three (a `SELECT` to find the
/// current row, an `INSERT` for the new one, an `UPDATE` to flip the old
/// one). An earlier draft chased this down to a *single* round trip with
/// an `AFTER INSERT` trigger; that turned out not to be the actual
/// bottleneck (see `new_immediate_write_transaction`) and introduced its
/// own correctness risk (a trigger recursing into the same table its own
/// statement is still executing over), so it was reverted in favor of this
/// plainer two-statement version.
///
/// The first round trip below is an `UPDATE... RETURNING`: it flips
/// whatever row is currently `state = 'current'` (if any) to
/// `superseded`/`trashed` per 's rule *and* returns everything
/// needed to build the new current row, so no separate up-front `SELECT`
/// is needed before it.
///
/// Every row this function writes -- all three branches -- is stamped with
/// `admitted_at_unix_nanos`, this device's own local clock read at the
/// moment of the write. Captured inside this function rather than passed
/// in, so no caller can supply it and no caller site needed to change.
/// Never `record.mtime_unix_nanos` -- see that column's own migration
/// comment in `yadorilink-sqlite-runtime`'s schema for why a replicated
/// filesystem timestamp is untrusted input here.
///
/// # The stamping invariant
///
/// This function is the ordinary per-path version write path, but it is
/// deliberately NOT the only writer of `files` rows, and the correctness of
/// everything reading `admitted_at_unix_nanos` rests on the whole set
/// agreeing. The invariant, stated once here because it is easy to break by
/// adding a fourth writer without noticing:
///
/// > **Every statement anywhere that inserts a `files` row stamps
/// > `admitted_at_unix_nanos` from this device's own clock at the moment of
/// > that write. A NULL means only "this row predates the column".**
///
/// The complete set of writers, all of which do:
///
/// * this function (three branches: new path, `version_seq = 0` scaffold
///   promotion, and superseding version bump),
/// * [`FileIndexRepository::ensure_bootstrap_row_for_metadata`] and
///   [`ensure_bootstrap_row_for_metadata_in_tx`], which insert the
///   `version_seq = 0` metadata scaffold.
///
/// Two consequences follow, and both are load-bearing rather than
/// incidental:
///
/// * Because every writer stamps, a NULL genuinely does mean "written
///   before the column existed" -- so `crate::rewind_plan` is entitled to
///   treat NULL rows as a prefix of a path's history and to report the
///   affected path as unanswerable rather than guessing.
/// * Several rows for one path can share a stamp when the clock is coarse.
///   The reader's `version_seq DESC` tie-break is what resolves that to the
///   path's current row.

///   lookup_materialized_generation`] is a fail-closed CAS read that
///   requires `published_under_mutation_generation` to still equal the
///   live fence value. A subsequent admission that mutates the same path
///   goes through the ordinary internal-mutator path, which bumps the
///   fence again before its own mutation -- at that instant this call's
///   row's captured epoch stops matching the live fence, so the lookup
///   used by zero-work settlement stops returning it (reads as absent, not
///   as a stale hit). Nothing added by this function weakens that
///   existing guarantee; it only ever produces rows that participate in
///   it.
/// - **F (crash before this transaction's commit)**: `write_immediate`'s
///   underlying `BEGIN IMMEDIATE ... COMMIT` is SQLite's own atomic unit --
///   a crash before `COMMIT` leaves neither the fence bump, the generation
///   row, nor the admitted local delta durable, because none of the
///   transaction's writes are visible outside it until commit succeeds.
///   The dirty-journal entry that triggered this capture in the first
///   place was written before the transaction started and survives
///   untouched, so the ordinary local-capture re-drive path picks the path
///   back up exactly as if this attempt never happened. No new failure
///   mode: this is the same atomicity every other `write_immediate` caller
///   in this file already relies on.
/// - **G (commit succeeds, but clearing the dirty-journal entry fails or
///   is delayed)**: the generation row and the admitted delta are now
///   durable; a redundant re-drive later observes the same disk state,
///   revalidates it (fingerprint/index/identity all still match), and
///   this function runs again -- `bump_mutation_fence` mints a new epoch,
///   `write_generation_row` writes a new row under it, replacing the
///   prior one (see `materialized_generation`'s "Immutability" doc: a row
///   is always replaced whole, never edited in place). The redundant
///   proof is content-identical to the one it replaces (same
