//! What follows the install: the bounded catch-up, then the replay of own intent.
//!
//! One machine, in this order:
//!
//! 1. the install replaces the group's state and moves the journal to `CatchingUp`;
//! 2. remote admission is open again (materialization and local authoring are not);
//! 3. [`catch_up`] drains whatever the connected peers can give now, bounded by
//!    [`CatchUpLimits`]; there is no frontier it must reach;
//! 4. the journal moves to `Replaying` and [`replay_own_intent`] authors the preserved own
//!    deltas, unit by unit, as deltas of the new incarnation;
//! 5. [`crate::native_rebootstrap::finish_rebootstrap`] ends the freeze.
//!
//! The journal state and the rows of `native_rebootstrap_delta` are the durable record of the
//! machine, so a crash at any boundary resumes where it was: nothing is authored twice and no
//! step is lost.
//!
//! # The replay
//!
//! The manifest lists the old own deltas in a topological order of their dependencies. A
//! [`ReplayStep`] is one of them with the [`ReplayIntent`]s of its ops, and the unit it belongs
//! to: a connected component over the removal edges, joined across the parts of one recursive
//! operation, so a put is never separated from the delete that removes it. Intents are derived
//! from the old signed delta and never the other way round. A step is replayed as ONE new delta
//! whose sequence number, chain link, provenance and head identities are those of the new
//! incarnation; removals are recomputed against the state the install left:
//!
//! * a removal of a head an earlier step put names the new delta that carries that put;
//! * a removal of any other head stays only while that head is live;
//! * an op left with neither a put nor a removal is dropped, and a step left with no op is
//!   `moot`.
//!
//! The residual parts of a partially covered recursive operation are a fresh operation: a new
//! id, parts numbered from zero, the residual count.
//!
//! The authority is asked again before each unit, never inside one. A unit it refuses is not
//! authored: its steps are recorded `unreplayed`, and the recovery area keeps its deltas and the
//! copies of its versions. The unit's transaction authors every step or none.
