//! Which directories on disk this device created only to hold replicated
//! descendants.
//!
//! A directory that exists on disk is one of two things, and they must
//! never be confused:
//!
//! * a **structural** directory: the materializer created it (`mkdir -p`
//!   of a parent) because a replicated entry below it needed a place to
//!   live. It is derived state. Nobody wrote it, so it is never captured as
//!   an explicit directory, and it goes away once nothing below it is
//!   live.
//! * an **explicit** directory: a user (or any other process) made it. It
//!   is a replicated entry in its own right, and outlives its contents.
//!
//! The filesystem does not say which one a directory is, and nothing
//! observable later can reconstruct it: "no explicit head, but children on
//! disk" fits a directory this device created for a peer's file exactly as
//! well as one a user created while the folder was unlinked. So the answer
//! is recorded at the moment it is known -- when this device creates the
//! directory -- and bound to the directory's filesystem identity, never
//! guessed afterwards. A directory with no record is `OriginUnknown`: it is
//! kept on disk and not authored as anything.
//!
//! # Two phases around the `mkdir`
//!
//! A directory's identity exists only after it is created, but the claim
//! has to be durable before it is created, or a crash between the two
//! leaves a directory this device made that nothing says it made -- which
//! capture would then read as a user's `mkdir`. So creation is bracketed:
//!
//! 1. [`record_structural_intent`] before the `mkdir`: a pending intent
//!    row, and a bump of the path's mutation fence, in one transaction.
//! 2. [`complete_structural_origin`] after a successful `mkdir`, with the
//!    identity observed (`lstat`) on the new directory: the intent becomes
//!    an origin bound to that identity.
//! 3. [`abandon_structural_intent`] if the `mkdir` found the name taken
//!    (`EEXIST`): whatever is there was not created by this call, so no
//!    origin is claimed for it.
//!
//! An intent that outlives its writer (a crash after `mkdir`, before step
//! 2) is dropped by [`drop_structural_intent_recording_lost_provenance`],
//! never completed. Completing it would mean deciding after the fact that the
//! directory now at the path is the one this device created, and nothing
//! on disk can prove that. Dropping it errs towards `OriginUnknown`, which
//! keeps the directory and authors nothing -- the direction that loses no
//! data.
//!
//! # Lost provenance is recorded too
//!
//! A directory with no record at all is one a user (or any other process)
//! made, and capture authors it as an explicit entry. That must not be
//! the reading for a directory this device may have made itself whose
//! record was lost -- an intent dropped before its `mkdir` completed, or
//! a completion refused because its intent was gone. Such a directory is
//! recorded with [`record_lost_structural_provenance`], bound to its
//! identity like an origin: [`structural_directory_origin`] reports it as
//! [`StructuralDirectoryOrigin::ProvenanceLost`], and capture keeps it and
//! authors nothing. Only that object: a directory made at the path later
//! is not covered by the record.
//!
//! # Identity, not path
//!
//! An origin names a directory by filesystem identity. The path is where
//! it was last seen: [`rekey_structural_origin`] follows a directory a
//! rename moved, and [`structural_directory_origin`]'s caller only ever
//! accepts the record for the object it is looking at
//! ([`StructuralDirectoryOrigin::status`]). A directory at a recorded path
//! with a different identity -- deleted and recreated, perhaps by a user --
//! inherits nothing.
//!
//! The ledger is device-local and outlives any one link of the folder: it
//! is about this disk, not about the history, so pruning or replacing the
//! history leaves it alone.
//!
//! Records are keyed by `(group_id, path)` with no separate root identity
//! (D6's "group / root identity"). The root is already bound per record:
//! each one carries the directory's full filesystem identity (volume,
//! object id and an anti-reuse discriminator), and nothing is accepted for
//! an object other than the one recorded. A group relinked at a different
//! root finds different objects at its paths, so the old records match
//! nothing and those directories are `OriginUnknown`; a root that was
//! moved or renamed keeps its objects, and keeps its provenance with them,
//! which a root-identity key would throw away.
