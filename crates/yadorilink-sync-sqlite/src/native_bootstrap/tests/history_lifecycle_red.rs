//! Specifications for the history lifecycle (rebootstrap, retirement of a
//! rotated-away incarnation, and the commitment of a closure by the signed
//! roots). Every test here describes behaviour the store has today.
//!
//! Where the operation under test does not exist yet (the rebootstrap install)
//! the test calls a small stand-in defined in this file. A stand-in does what
//! the store does today, so the assertion that follows it observes today's
//! behaviour; when the real operation exists, the stand-in is replaced by it
//! and nothing else changes.
