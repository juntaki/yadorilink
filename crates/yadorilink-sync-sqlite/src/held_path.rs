//! `HeldPathRepository` owns `held_paths`: the paths
//! whose object on disk belongs to no row this device placed, and whose disk
//! the reconciliation pass has not looked at yet.
//!
//! A path is held when a local edit cannot be authored there (this replica's
//! own bucket at the path is full), so the bytes on disk are an edit nothing
//! may publish: authoring them would supersede heads the writer was never
//! shown. A hold is the durable record of that state.
//!
//! While a path is held:
//!
//! - local capture authors nothing for it -- no edit, no offline deletion
//!   (local capture consults [`held_paths`], and every local-authoring
//!   entry point in [`crate::file_index`] refuses a held path in its own
//!   transaction with [`SyncSqliteError::PathAwaitingHeldPathReconciliation`]);
//! - the projection scheduler does not claim it
//!   ([`crate::projection_obligations::claim_runnable_obligations`]), and no
//!   materializer writes it, since writing the row's version would overwrite
//!   whatever is there without looking at it.
//!
//! The reconciliation pass is the one writer of a held path. It classifies
//! the object on disk against the row the index holds there:
//!
//! - nothing there: the row's placeholder is placed;
//! - an untouched placeholder of the row is already its projection and is
//!   kept;
//! - a directory is not the path's to move: its entries are other paths;
//! - anything else is an edit no row accounts for, so it is preserved rather
//!   than authored: it is moved aside to a conflict-copy name, which local
//!   capture then captures as a new file.
//!
//! Then it places the row's projection and releases the hold with
//! [`release_in_tx`]. A change observed at the path after the release is an
//! ordinary local edit: the only thing on disk at that point is what the
//! reconciliation itself placed.
