//! `path_materialized_generations`: the durable record of what the engine
//! believes the disk currently reflects for a path, kept separate from
//! what native state resolves that path to (`DiskGenerationBasis`). This
//! module is deliberately narrow: it records and reads one row per
//! `(group_id, path)`. Nothing here decides *when* a generation should
//! change -- that is a caller's job, restated here because it is easy to
//! get backwards: a new admission (desired state) must never touch this
//! table; a row here changes only after a filesystem placement has been
//! observed committed and durably recorded. # Immutability A generation's
//! basis (the path's reflected heads, [`crate::materialization_basis`]) is
//! fixed for its lifetime: if the heads a path reflects move, that is a
//! *new* generation, never an edit to the old one's basis. Every write
//! replaces every column together under a freshly minted [`GenerationId`]
//! -- there is no "update just the basis" function to reach for by
//! mistake. # Absence is a generation too A path with nothing on disk is
//! not "no row" -- it is a row whose `object_kind` is
//! [`MaterializedObjectKind::Absent`], `version` is `None`, and
//! `filesystem_identity` is `None`. The basis is still the heads whose
//! resolution produced that absence.
//! [`record_materialized_generation`] does not special-case this: an
//! absent generation is written through the exact same call as a present
//! one, with `object_kind: Absent`, so there is no separate path to forget
//! to handle it on. The module lives alongside `dag_store` in this crate so
//! both can share one transaction.
