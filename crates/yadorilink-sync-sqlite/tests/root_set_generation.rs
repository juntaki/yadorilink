//! The change-detector behind the background custody summary.

//! Its whole job is to be *total*: a `files` write that does not move the
//! generation is a write a memoised digest will not notice, and a memo that
//! does not notice a write hands a peer comparison a digest the table no
//! longer supports — a false positive in the one direction the durability
//! design must never produce.
//!
//! So these tests go at the counter through raw SQL rather than through the
//! repository API. The point is not that today's write paths bump it; it is
//! that nothing written against this table can avoid bumping it, including
//! code that does not exist yet.
