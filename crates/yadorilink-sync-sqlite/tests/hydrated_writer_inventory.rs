//! Every production line that stamps `MaterializationState::Hydrated`,
//! pinned by name.
//!
//! `Hydrated` is an exact claim about disk, and the invariant this
//! workspace maintains is that it is never observable without a usable
//! actual-state generation naming the same version in the same durable
//! commit. Producers were brought to that one at a time -- peer hydration,
//! daemon hydration, both repair lanes, the eager batch, restore, local
//! capture -- and each was a real defect before it was fixed. What none of
//! that prevents is the next writer: `set_materialization_state` is a
//! perfectly ordinary repository method, and stamping the claim with it is
//! a one-line change that no type rejects and no existing test notices.
//!
//! So the set is enumerated here instead. A new production stamp fails
//! this test with the file and line it was added at, and the fix is either
//! to publish the proof alongside it -- through
//! `commit_internal_materialized_state_if_fence_current` for a writer that
//! performed its own write, or the local-capture adoption path for one
//! that observed someone else's -- or, if it genuinely belongs, to add it
//! here with the reason.
//!
//! Tests and fixtures are deliberately out of scope: seeding a row into a
//! state is how a test sets up the situation it is about, and forbidding
//! that would only push fixtures into writing the column by hand.
