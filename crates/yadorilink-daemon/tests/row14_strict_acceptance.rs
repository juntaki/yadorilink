//! Strict release-candidate acceptance harness for the `taguchi_row_14`
//! permanent-stall fix (`fix/conflict-copy-convergence-obligation-20260723`).
//! `TestDevice`/`setup_device`/etc. are intentionally duplicated from
//! `taguchi_collision_matrix.rs` rather than shared -- matches this
//! codebase's existing convention of self-contained daemon integration test
//! binaries (see that file's own doc comment for the same reasoning).
//!
//! This is deliberately a *stricter* bar than "the row-14 test passed":
//!
//! 1. The periodic 90s materialization-repair sweep is disabled for the
//!    whole run (`set_default_materialization_repair_sweep_interval_for_
//!    tests`), so a pass can only be attributed to the Convergence
//!    Engine's own per-tick reconciliation -- never the old sweep quietly
//!    rescuing it, which would make it impossible to tell which mechanism
//!    actually converged the run.
//! 2. The longest no-progress gap seen during the run is tracked directly
//!    (not merely whether it crossed the stall-panic threshold) and must
//!    stay comfortably under it -- "never actually stalled" is a stronger
//!    claim than "recovered before the watchdog fired."
//! 3. After convergence, every device's `materialization_jobs` table must
//!    have zero non-terminal rows left -- nothing stuck in `Planning`/
//!    `Backoff`/`Pending` forever, invisible only because the strict
//!    content-hash comparison happened to pass anyway.
//! 4. The strict content-hash comparison itself (inherited from the
//!    ordinary row-14 test) already covers "a path that went through a
//!    retriable placeholder ends up with disk content matching the
//!    winner" -- every device's bytes must match, not just their file-name
//!    sets.
//!
//! Panics, background-task restarts, and SQLite lock errors during a run
//! are deliberately NOT asserted against from *inside* this test -- they're
//! checked by the acceptance script that repeatedly invokes this binary,
//! grepping each iteration's full captured stdout/stderr, since a
//! backgrounded `supervise::spawn_restarting` task's own panic does not
//! automatically fail the top-level `#[tokio::test]`.
