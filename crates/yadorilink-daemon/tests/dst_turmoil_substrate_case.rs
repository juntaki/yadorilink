//! A `Case`'s fault schedule, driven on its own clock, stopping and
//! restoring real substrate traffic.
//!
//! This is the join every previous piece was built toward, and each of those
//! pieces was landed alone so that a failure here has somewhere to point:
//!
//! ```text
//! Case::fault_schedule   (nanosecond offsets)
//!   ↓  run_schedule       -- when each fault fires
//!   ↓  CarrierFaults      -- which endpoints a device index means
//!   ↓  SimFaultController -- which links are cut
//!   ↓  FaultInjectingTransport
//!   ↓  real iroh QUIC over a real block lane
//! ```
//!
//! # What Turmoil is doing here, and what it is not
//!
//! Turmoil supplies the host scheduler, the virtual clock and the host
//! lifecycle. Device A and device B are separate hosts, so their futures are
//! stepped independently and a seed decides the order.
//!
//! It is **not** carrying the substrate's datagrams. Those ride iroh's custom
//! transport into `TestNetwork`, which is a different simulated network with
//! its own faults, owned by `SimFaultController`. Putting two devices on two
//! Turmoil hosts therefore does not mean their blocks crossed Turmoil's
//! network, and nothing here claims it does. When the control plane arrives
//! it will ride Turmoil's sockets, and a partition will have to cut both
//! planes to be a device partition at all.
