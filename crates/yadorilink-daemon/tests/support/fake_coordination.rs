//! In-process fake of the Cloudflare-Worker coordination plane, for the full-
//! stack E2E tests that drive the real [`peer_orchestrator`]. It is a test
//! fixture, not a second coordination implementation: it implements only the
//! four endpoints the daemon touches at runtime, and only enough of each to
//! make peer discovery, per-group write authorization, and revocation happen.
//!
//!   - `GET /netmap/subscribe?deviceId=` (WebSocket): pushes `{type:"netmap"}`
//!     frames — the sole seam that makes the orchestrator spawn and tear down
//!     peer sessions.
//!   - `POST /devices/:id/endpoint`: answered `204`
//!     (best-effort on the daemon).
//!
//! Revocation is expressed exactly as the real plane expresses it: recompute
//! the netmap without the revoked peer or group and push it; the orchestrator
//! diffs against its previous snapshot and drops the session (or the group
//! edge). There is no explicit "removed" field on the wire — a peer simply
