//! Canonical 3-node topology -- N (Full Replica, "home NAS"
//! role conceptually), M and W (On-Demand, "Mac"/"Windows" roles
//! conceptually). Shared, reusable base for the multi-node acceptance
//! scenarios (moved here from `tests/topology_n_m_w.rs` once a second test
//! binary needed it too -- integration test FILES are separate crates
//! and cannot `use` each other directly, only shared `tests/support/`
//! modules).
//!
//! Real production code at every layer this exercises: real
//! `DaemonState`, real `peer_orchestrator`-driven `PeerChannel`/
//! QUIC-shaped sessions over loopback UDP, real DAG mutation propagation
//! via the real filesystem watcher (`std::fs::write` on a linked local
//! folder, not a raw DB upsert -- `monkey_chaos.rs`'s established
//! convention), real `MaterializationPolicy::OnDemand` storage mode
//! (`storage_mode_orchestration.rs`'s API), real custody-confirmation
//! sweep (`DaemonState::refresh_custody_confirmation`, the same method
//! `DurabilityConfirmationJob` calls periodically in production), real
//! `group_durability_status` derivation.
//!
//! **Not** OS-native (CfAPI/File Provider) acceptance -- this proves the
//! application/daemon/transport/storage integration above the
//! platform-native boundary, not Explorer/Finder lifecycle behavior.
//!
//! The peer-device relay mechanism this file's topology helpers once also
//! covered (a relay-anchor role, forced-relay routing, `RelayGrant`
//! wiring) was physically removed together with the rest of that
//! mechanism: the Iroh relay
//! carries the reconciliation/block/service substrate directly now, with
//! no per-peer relay session for a topology helper to force or wire a
//! grant source for.
//!
//! `#![allow(dead_code)]`: every integration test FILE under `tests/` is
//! its own separate compilation unit that includes the whole `support`
//! module tree via `mod support;`, regardless of which parts it actually
//! uses -- `-D warnings` clippy (this crate's CI gate) sees every item
//! here as dead code from the perspective of any sibling test binary
//! that doesn't happen to reference `topology`, exactly like
//! `fake_coordination.rs`'s existing per-method `#[allow(dead_code)]`
//! annotations already handle for the same reason, just applied at the

///
/// 1. Nothing reports. `AddressDirectory::publish` reaches

///    real `app.rs` startup. `spawn_orchestrator`
///    below mirrors `peer_orchestrator::run` and nothing else, so the watch
///    write has no reader and no endpoint report is ever POSTed.
/// 2. Nothing fans out. `FakeCoordination` stores a substrate report it does
///    receive, but its netmap frame carries `endpoints` only -- no
///    `substrateReachability` key. The daemon's own netmap decoder defaults
///    that field to `None`, so `project_substrate_reachability` takes its
///    compatibility branch and records relay URLs alone, leaving direct
///    addresses empty. No relay runs in these fixtures, so nothing dialable
///    results.
///
/// Teaching the fake to fan substrate reachability out -- the production
/// route, `endpoint report -> plane state -> netmap -> peer projection ->
/// address directory` -- would retire this helper fixture by fixture. That is

/// runs, pinned policy epoch/seq/head, per-device issuance counter, signed
