//! The join between a `Case`'s network faults and the simulated carrier that
//! can actually enforce them.
//!
//! A `Case` names devices by index, because it is a serialized artefact that
//! outlives any particular run and must not hold anything as run-specific as
//! an endpoint identity. The carrier names them by `EndpointId`, because that
//! is what a datagram is addressed to. This module is the table between the
//! two and nothing else: it decides no policy, holds no state of its own, and
//! translates one fault at a time.
//!
//! Kept separate from the carrier deliberately. If a scenario partitions two
//! devices and their blocks flow anyway, the question is whether the mapping
//! was wrong or the carrier was, and those are only separable while they are
//! separate pieces.
//!
//! Only `Partition` and `Heal` are carried across so far. The rest of
//! `NetFault` is reported as unimplemented rather than quietly ignored --
//! see [`CarrierOutcome`].
//!
//! `#[cfg(turmoil)]`: the carrier is a `test-support` type of
//! `yadorilink-lane-ports`, and only the turmoil build is meant to reach it.
