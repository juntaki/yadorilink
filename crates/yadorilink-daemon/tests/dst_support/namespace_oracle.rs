//! Directory-aware oracles: the checks every earlier oracle in this harness
//! is structurally blind to, because each of them walks regular files only
//! (`oracle.rs`'s `walk_recursive`, `directory_conflict_matrix.rs`'s
//! `recursive_snapshot`, `collision_matrix.rs`'s snapshot). Under those, a
//! peer left holding an empty `linux/` after `rm -rf linux/` elsewhere, a
//! path that is a directory on one device and a file on the other, and a
//! File `a` silently dropped because `a/x` needed `a` to be a directory all
//! read GREEN.
//!
//! The model checked against: files, directories and symlinks are
//! path-scoped replicated entries (explicit state `E`, one set of live heads
//! per path); a directory needed only to hold surviving descendants is a
//! *structural* container derived from `E`, never replicated; deleting a
//! directory never deletes a concurrently surviving descendant; and the
//! desired physical tree is a pure function `project(E)`.
//!
//! * **Projection oracles** (pure, over explicit state `E` and the tree
//!   `project(E)` from `yadorilink_replica_engine::namespace`):
//!   [`check_projection`] re-derives `NeedsDirectory` independently of
//!   `project` and compares the directory set, explicit-vs-structural
//!   labelling, tree well-formedness, and data preservation on shape
//!   conflicts (every live content version is placed somewhere, nothing
//!   is invented). [`check_projection_purity`] checks that `project` is a
//!   function of the head *sets*: head order, tombstone-only paths and
//!   repetition must not change the tree.
//! * **Disk oracles** (over a kind-aware walk of a real root,
//!   [`disk_tree`]): [`check_disk_against_projection`] compares one
//!   device's physical tree to the projection — kind mismatches, missing
//!   directories, and directories the engine is responsible for left behind
//!   with nothing tracked or untracked inside (the `rm -rf` leftover). A
//!   directory the projection does not want but that still holds content
//!   no replica knows about is *retained* (the engine never deletes
//!   content it does not track); one the engine has no origin for is
//!   *unowned* and kept whatever it holds (an empty directory is not
//!   proof the engine made it). Both are returned for inspection, not
//!   violations.
//!   [`check_retained_claims`] holds the product's own "retained" reports
//!   to that split in both directions.
//!   [`check_trees_converge`] is the kind-aware cross-device convergence
//!   check.
//!
//! Deliberately free of the simulator and of any daemon type: it is
//! included both as `dst_support::namespace_oracle` (turmoil builds) and by
//! plain integration tests through `#[path]`, so the real-stack matrices can
//! assert the same directory invariants as the DST sweep.
