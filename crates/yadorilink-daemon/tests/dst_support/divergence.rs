//! First-divergence
//! localization as a **standalone reducer**.
//!
//! The design has the incremental-oracle observer ride harden's triage-replay
//! standard-profile leg (one automatic same-seed replay, no cost on passing
//! runs). That replay leg does not exist on this branch, so the localization
//! logic is factored out here as a pure reducer that a replay hook feeds one
//! boolean sample per event boundary: "does the terminal violation's predicate
//! hold *now*?". Keeping it standalone means it is fully unit-testable without
//! a running simulation, and harden's replay leg later just calls `observe`.
//!
//! It records the earliest simulated time at which the predicate first holds
//! and never subsequently clears (design's `first_observable`) — deliberately
//! an *observation* point, not a root-cause claim.
