//! The one place a DST scenario constructs its simulated runtime.
//!
//! Keeping that construction here, rather than inline in every scenario,
//! means no scenario file carries its own copy of seed handling or time
//! budget to drift.
//!
//! The substrate is turmoil, selected with `--cfg turmoil`. The real `tokio`
//! this crate normally compiles against is kept; determinism comes from
//! turmoil's stepped runtime and its paused clock, and simulated sockets are
//! opt-in per call site rather than global.
//!
//! It is not a default: a plain `cargo test` does not set the cfg and never
//! compiles this file at all.
//!
//! # What is deliberately *not* promised
//!
//! A seed reproduces a run *on this substrate*. Equivalence with any other
//! execution is asserted at the level the Case IR already defines: the same
//! serialized `Case` must satisfy the same oracle. See `case_ir.rs`.

///   running out) both surface through the same `run()` result. They are
///   separated here so a scenario failure never reads as a harness timeout,
///   and vice versa.
/// * `enable_random_order` is what makes distinct seeds explore distinct
///   host orderings. Without it a seed only varies turmoil's network
///   latency draws, which for a single-host scenario is no variation at all.
/// * Two peers placed on the *same* host do not talk over the simulated
///   network at all: turmoil delivers same-host traffic directly. So a
///   scenario that puts both devices on one host to "remove a variable" has
///   removed the network instead, and neither a partition nor a latency draw
///   will reach it. Two devices that must be able to lose each other need
///   two hosts.
