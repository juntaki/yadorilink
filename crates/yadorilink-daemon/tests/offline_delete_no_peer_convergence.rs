//! A file deleted from disk while the daemon was stopped must settle, on a
//! device that has no peer.
//!
//! The sibling scenario to `local_import_restart_convergence`, one step
//! further along: the folder is imported and quiet, then the daemon stops,
//! then a file is removed from the folder by something that is not this
//! daemon -- another process, a file manager, a user at a shell. On the
//! next start the reconciliation scan is the only thing that can notice,
//! and it emits an offline-deletion tombstone.
//!
//! What the device has to end up with is a consistent trio for that path:
//! the DAG resolves it to absent, nothing is still owed for it, and its
//! actual-state record says absent rather than still naming the content
//! that used to be there. Any two of those without the third is a path
//! that either never goes quiet or claims to hold bytes that are gone --
//! and with no peer to ask, nothing else will ever correct it.
//!
//! Deliberately single-device, for the same reason the import test is: a
//! peer is precisely the thing being proven unnecessary.
