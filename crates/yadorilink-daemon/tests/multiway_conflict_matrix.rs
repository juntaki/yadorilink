//! Permanent, generalized regression test superseding the temporary
//! `three_way_conflict_diag.rs` diagnostic.
//!
//! Background: naming a conflict copy from the resolving session's
//! `local_device_id`/`peer_device_id` is correct for a single pairwise
//! resolution, but once a third (or later) device's edit triggers a
//! *second* round of pairwise resolution involving a path that no longer
//! represents this device's own unmediated edit, that naming would
//! misattribute content -- a conflict-copy path embedding one device's id
//! but holding a DIFFERENT device's content. The conflict-copy name must
//! therefore carry the content's true origin device, never whichever peer
//! session happened to process it.
//!
//! This file generalizes that one scenario into a small matrix across
//! device count (3, 4, 5, 6) and write timing (simultaneous vs
//! staggered), all asserting the SAME correctness property the
//! diagnostic checked: after convergence, every device must agree on
//! the exact same (name -> content-hash) map. A "mismatch" bug
//! manifests as devices disagreeing about which name holds which
//! content, NOT merely differing file counts -- so the assertion below
//! compares full snapshots, never just `.len`.
//!
//! Run this file repeatedly (e.g. via a heat-run script) across the
//! device-count / timing grid to characterize the conflict resolver's
//! convergence behavior. Do not weaken the core assertion to a
//! file-count check -- that would silently hide the exact class of bug
//! this file exists to catch.
