//! Regression coverage for mesh-authority splitting in the test harness:
//! pairing A-B,
//! then C-D, then B-C (bridging the two previously separate pairs) used to
//! leave D -- never named in the bridging call -- permanently pointed at
//! the now-abandoned second `FakeCoordination`, since `DaemonState::
//! coordination_client_config` is a `OnceLock` and cannot be migrated once
//! set. A Published Change crossing that island boundary verified against
//! the wrong authority key and was silently dropped -- indistinguishable,
//! from a test's own diagnostics, from "never received at all".
//!
//! There is no way to fix this after the fact (see `support::
//! checkpoint_fake_for`'s doc comment), so the real fix is `support::
//! TestPeerMesh`: one shared authority from construction, used for every
//! pairing in a test that connects more than two devices. This file checks
//! both halves: `TestPeerMesh` actually unifies a bridged mesh (positive),
//! and the old free-function path fails LOUD rather than silently
//! producing a split-brain authority if a test tries the unsafe shape
//! anyway (negative -- a regression guard against someone "fixing" the
//! assertion away instead of migrating to `TestPeerMesh`).
