//! Acceptance tests for the `ReconnectCoordinator` (a single global
//! semaphore bounding how many peer supervisors may be mid-handshake-attempt
//! at once, see `peer_orchestrator::NetmapDiffState::reconnect_semaphore`)
//! plus the ABA-race fix to `NetmapDiffState::channels`'s natural-session-end
//! cleanup (`remove_channel_if_current`).
//!
//! Drives the real production stack exactly like `reconnect_handshake_stress.
//! rs` and `chaos_coordination_unreachable.rs` (real `DaemonState` +
//! `LinkRuntimeController` + `peer_orchestrator::run` against an in-process
//! `FakeCoordination`), star-topology rather than full mesh: a hub device
//! plus N leaves, each leaf sharing a group with the hub ONLY (never with
//! each other) -- keeps connection count and this file's own runtime cost at
//! O(N), not O(N^2), which is exactly the N-to-1 fan-in shape the
//! ReconnectCoordinator bounds, and is also the shape a real "many peers reconnecting to
//! one already-established machine" event actually has (a laptop waking from
//! sleep, a Wi-Fi roam, a network flap).
//!
//! **What "simultaneous" means here:** `FakeCoordination::revoke` and
//! `register_device` are plain synchronous methods (no `.await` inside their
//! own body) -- calling them back-to-back in a tight loop with no `.await`
//! between iterations cannot be interleaved with anything else on this
//! task, so the whole batch really does land as one atomic moment from the
//! runtime's perspective, not merely "close together". Only the
//! `register_with_fake` re-registration loop (which does real socket setup)
//! is unavoidably sequential; that's fine, since by that point the
//! simultaneous *loss* has already landed and every affected leaf's own
//! supervisor is independently racing its own reconnect regardless of what
//! order this test happens to call `register_with_fake` in.
//!
//! **What "connection loss" means for scenario B:** this file reuses the
//! same revoke-then-reregister technique `reconnect_handshake_stress.rs`
//! itself uses as its network-blip stand-in (see that file's own module doc
//! comment) rather than inventing a lower-level socket-cut simulation --
//! consistent with this codebase's established convention for these
//! full-stack tests, and honestly documented as such here too.
