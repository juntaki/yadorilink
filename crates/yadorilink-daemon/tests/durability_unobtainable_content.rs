//! M5-A soak-closure durability investigation: deterministic regression
//! for the durability-stuck-Protecting finding (`m5a-pass9-link-runtime-
//! stop-fence-gap` in project memory; see the tracked comment on
//! `topology_soak_lane.rs`'s `randomized_soak_converges_with_no_leaks_or_
//! stuck_state` for the full root-cause trace).
//!
//! Root cause: a full-replica device's `Placeholder` row can legitimately
//! have NO obtainable holder among current membership -- its sole
//! provenance-verified holder left the group, and every other current
//! peer explicitly refuses the fetch (`FetchOutcome::Rejected`, "no
//! verified group provenance"), not merely times out. `materialization:
//! Partial` alone cannot distinguish "still trying, may yet succeed" from
//! "genuinely, permanently gone", so `classify` stayed at `Protecting`
//! forever. Fixed via a new `DurabilityFacts::known_unobtainable_
//! required_content` fact (backed by a durable `block_fetch_refusals`
//! table, written only on an EXPLICIT peer refusal, never a transient
//! miss) that routes to the EXISTING `AtRisk` variant -- no new
//! `GroupDurabilityStatus` variant, per explicit user instruction. The
//! conflict/content record itself is NEVER auto-retired: an unobtainable
//! record may be a user's only surviving edit, and silently deleting the
//! metadata would turn real data loss into apparent convergence.
//!
//! This test constructs the scenario directly rather than racing the
//! soak's own chaos for it: X (an OnDemand device) authors unique
//! content that fully propagates and hydrates on N (the full replica)
//! normally -- no timing games needed. N's copy is then put back into
//! the exact state a "never got a chance to fetch it" full replica would
//! be in: `hydration::evict` (the same real production operation
//! `topology_soak_lane.rs`'s own `op_evict` exercises) demotes the row
//! to `Placeholder`, then the underlying block bytes are deleted
//! directly from N's own block store. The direct deletion is necessary
//! and deliberate, not a shortcut: `gc::run_sweep` never reclaims a
//! still-CURRENT version's blocks (a full replica is supposed to keep
//! serving its current content forever, regardless of local
//! materialization state -- confirmed live, `blocks_deleted == 0` on
//! every attempt), so eviction alone leaves N able to trivially
//! "re-fetch" from its own already-present bytes with no peer involved
//! at all. X then genuinely leaves the group
//! (`FakeCoordination::remove_device`), and M/W (which never
//! independently held X's content -- they are OnDemand and never fetch
//! eagerly) are asked by N's own periodic materialization-repair sweep
//! and explicitly refuse.
