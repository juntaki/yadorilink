//! Two-device races around Windows-specific path-naming hazards, run
//! through the real full daemon stack — complementary to
//! `yadorilink-sync-core/src/hazard.rs`'s pure unit tests (`RESERVED_
//! BASENAMES`, `invalid_name_reason`, `NamePolicy`), which only prove the
//! hazard-detection *logic* in isolation against a bare `SyncState` +
//! tempdir, and to `yadorilink-sync-sqlite`'s own `dag_store::tests`
//! (`admit_change_rejects_a_reserved_windows_device_name_path`/
//! `emit_local_change_refuses_a_reserved_windows_device_name`/their
//! trailing-dot/illegal-character siblings), which prove the DAG-admission
//! rejection this file's scenarios 1-3 depend on returns the right `Result`
//! directly, on both the receiving and local-authoring call sites, without
//! any daemon/network machinery in the way. This file instead exercises
//! what actually happens end-to-end when two real devices race to create a
//! hazardous name over the real watcher/local-capture/peer-session/signing
//! pipeline.
//!
//! **Current understanding, read directly out of the source (this
//! corrects an earlier version of this file's header, which described the
//! OPPOSITE of scenarios 1-3's actual mechanism — the two must not be
//! left contradicting each other in one file):**
//!
//! - Scenarios 1-3 below (`concurrent_create_of_a_windows_reserved_
//!   basename`, `concurrent_create_with_trailing_dot_or_space`,
//!   `concurrent_create_with_illegal_windows_characters`) all trip
//!   `yadorilink_root_authority::reserved_namespace::path_has_non_
//!   portable_wire_component`, invoked via `yadorilink_sync_sqlite::
//!   dag_store::serving_authorization_index::validate_no_reserved_paths`.
//!   Per that function's own doc comment ("An independent review's
//!   finding"), this check is **platform-independent** (never gated on
//!   `cfg!(windows)`) and runs on **both** the receiving side
//!   (`admit_change`) and the local-authoring side (`emit_local_change`
//!   and its own callers). So a hazardous name is refused DAG admission
//!   the moment each device tries to capture its OWN local write — before
//!   there is ever a change to send to a peer, let alone materialize or
//!   hold. Each device keeps only its own local content forever; neither
//!   ever learns the other created the same (or a different) hazardous
//!   name at all. This is a permanent, by-design refusal, not a timing
//!   gap, and it applies identically on every platform — there is no
//!   "Windows device" vs. "non-Windows device" distinction for this check
//!   at all, unlike scenario 4 below.
//! - `PeerSyncSession::hazard_reason_for` (host-gated on
//!   `hazard::NamePolicy::local`, evaluated only inside `materialize`/
//!   `hydrate_file` when a device is about to write a RECEIVED record to
//!   disk) is a SEPARATE, materialize-time mechanism this file's scenarios
//!   1-3 do NOT exercise at all: `validate_no_reserved_paths` rejects
//!   these hazardous names at DAG admission, before any of them could ever
//!   reach a receiving device's `materialize` call. Since both simulated
//!   devices in this file share one OS process, there is also no way,
//!   within one test run, to have one simulated device be "the Windows
//!   one" for that host-gated mechanism regardless — `cfg!(windows)` would
//!   branch per test-run, not per device.
//! - Scenario 4 (`long_path_near_windows_max_path_length`) is a genuinely
//!   different, unrelated code path: Windows' `MAX_PATH` is an OS/Win32-API
//!   constraint with nothing to do with `hazard.rs`'s or `reserved_
//!   namespace`'s logic. Both devices' creates ARE admitted and
//!   materialized normally here (a real create/create conflict-copy
//!   scenario, same shape as `collision_matrix.rs`'s scenario 1) — this
//!   scenario's own doc comment covers its own ground truth separately.

// --- Scenario 4: a full path near Windows' traditional MAX_PATH (260) ------

/// Builds a relative path (nested directories plus a filename) long enough
/// that the *full* path -- including the temp sync root -- comfortably
/// exceeds Windows' traditional 260-character `MAX_PATH` (without
/// `\\?\`-prefix long-path support). Both devices create it concurrently
/// with different content, same shape as `collision_matrix.rs` scenario 1,
/// checked directly at the deep path rather than via a root-level directory
/// listing (`real_entry_names` only lists one directory's immediate
/// entries).
///
/// This specifically needs re-verification on the real Windows test machine
/// from manual Windows VM testing: `MAX_PATH` is an OS/Win32-API-level
/// constraint that has nothing to do with this crate's own `hazard.rs`
/// logic, so nothing read while writing this file rules out a real failure
/// there (e.g. `CreateFileW` rejecting the path outright, or requiring the
/// `\\?\` long-path prefix this codebase's materialization writes don't
/// appear to add). On the current platform this is expected to simply work,
/// since Linux/macOS impose no such component-count-independent path-length
/// ceiling in the range this test builds.
