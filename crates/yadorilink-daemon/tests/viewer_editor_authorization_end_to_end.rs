//! Proves the whole sharing-roles authorization pipeline works together,
//! not just each half in isolation.
//!
//! Under checkpoint admission, there is exactly ONE writer-authorization enforcement point
//! left: checkpoint ISSUANCE, server-side on the coordination plane. Local
//! emission is unconditional (any device may author a Pending Change
//! regardless of role -- see `replica_coordinator.rs`'s
//! `LocalPolicyHeadProvider` doc comment), and a Change with no checkpoint
//! is structurally ineligible for `send_change_batch` to ever serve, so
//! there is no "local gate a malicious client could bypass" left to prove
//! defense-in-depth against -- the old scenarios (c)/(g)/(h) (a bypassed
//! local gate, and a stale pre-downgrade `ChangeAuth` pin replay) tested
//! exactly that removed mechanism and were deleted rather than patched:
//! their premise cannot be constructed under the new architecture without
//! forging a wire-level checkpoint directly, which belongs to
//! `yadorilink-peer-session`'s own wire-protocol test suite (see item 16's
//! "tampered checkpoint/proof/key/Change/reference fails" requirement
//! there), not this crate's real-daemon end-to-end harness.
//!
//! This file drives the real pipeline: a real signed role-carrying grant
//! record (`support::fake_coordination::FakeCoordination::grant_role`,
//! built with this crate's own `change_policy::policy_signing::
//! grant_record` -- the exact shape `coordination-worker`'s
//! `recordGrantWithRole` produces) is served over a real HTTP/WebSocket
//! netmap subscription, fetched and verified by a real daemon
//! (`peer_orchestrator::run`), and enforced by the fake coordination
//! plane's own checkpoint-issuance endpoint refusing a non-writer's
//! request -- full-stack, like `revocation_end_to_end.rs`'s own tests.
//!
//! Two scenarios:
//!   (a) a Viewer-granted device's own local edit is captured locally as a
//!       Pending Change but never syncs anywhere -- checkpoint issuance
//!       refuses it.
//!   (b) the same setup with an Editor grant instead: the local edit gets
//!       checkpointed and syncs normally -- the control proving this
//!       harness genuinely distinguishes the two roles.
//!
//! A second pair covers a DIFFERENT code path guarded by the same
//! checkpoint-issuance gate: `dag_import::ensure_initial_import`/
//! `backfill_missing_history`, which convert a device's pre-existing
//! on-disk content into signed change history the first time a group is
//! linked (or via the mid-life coverage audit) -- not the live
//! filesystem-watcher path scenarios (a)/(b) drive.
//!   (d) a Viewer-granted device's pre-existing content (written to disk
//!       before the group is linked) is never checkpointed and never syncs
//!       to a peer.
//!   (e) the same setup with an Editor grant instead: the pre-existing
//!       content imports and syncs normally.
//!
//! A third pair covers a LIVE role CHANGE while a session is already
//! connected -- the security property that a privilege reduction must
//! invalidate an already-established session's authority promptly, not
//! merely on its next reconnect. `support::fake_coordination::
//! FakeCoordination::downgrade_role` drives the exact chained
//! Revoke-then-Grant record pair `coordination-worker`'s live role-change
//! endpoint produces for a downgrade (a plain Revoke, bumping the group's
//! `auth_epoch`, immediately followed by a Grant at the new, lower role).
//!   (f) an Editor-granted device's session is proven live (a real edit
//!       syncs normally), then downgraded to Viewer WITHOUT tearing down or
//!       reconnecting either daemon's session -- proven by the exact same
//!       `Arc<PeerSyncSession>` on both sides before and after. A NEW local
//!       edit made after the downgrade becomes authoritative is withheld
//!       exactly like scenario (a)'s from-the-start Viewer, proving the
//!       downgrade closed the window promptly through the existing live
//!       netmap-push mechanism, with no daemon-side code change needed.

/// where a trusted peer is honestly relaying somebody else's already-signed
/// history, it makes a downgraded device's legitimately pre-downgrade work
/// permanently undeliverable to any peer that does not already hold it: the
/// author will never be a current writer again, and no other device was ever
/// allowed to speak for it. That is silent, needs no attacker, and hits the
/// ordinary cases -- a new device joining, a device returning after a long
/// absence, a full-replica handoff target.
///
/// The scenario: an Editor authors a file and syncs it to a second Editor,
/// so it is genuine, admitted history on that peer. The author is then
/// downgraded to Viewer and goes offline, closing its network endpoint, so
/// delivery to the third device is unambiguously a relay and cannot have
/// come from the author itself. A third device joins fresh as an Editor and
/// must still converge on the author's pre-downgrade file, obtained entirely
/// from the relaying peer.
///
/// Offline, not merely hidden: a downgraded author is still a group member,
/// so every other member is still authorized to connect to it, and a peer
/// session opens wherever the network reaches it -- including by local-network
/// discovery, which finds a device on the same host no matter what endpoints
/// the coordination plane lists for it.
///
/// Note what is NOT relaxed: the author is still a Viewer everywhere, and
/// scenario (h) above -- which must stay green, unmodified -- proves the same
/// author pushing its OWN Change under that same stale pin is still refused.
