//! Migrated from `yadorilink-peer-session`'s dead hazard-hold tests.
//!
//! Deleting the head-announcement Change protocol removed the
//! only wire mechanism `PeerSyncSession` ever had for telling a connected
//! peer about a new/changed DAG record. Five tests in
//! `yadorilink-peer-session/tests/peer_session.rs` built two bare
//! `PeerSyncSession::standalone()` instances and expected a change authored
//! on one to reach the other via that now-deleted mechanism -- dead on Linux
//! (an early `is_case_insensitive_filesystem` guard fired first and the
//! body, including the now-impossible propagation, never ran) and hanging
//! for real on macOS (the guard doesn't fire there, so the body ran and
//! waited forever). The real replacement for DAG propagation is this
//! daemon's `ReconciliationDriver` (RBSR/substrate-based), which lives
//! entirely outside `yadorilink-peer-session` -- so all five are migrated
//! here, driven through the real full daemon stack (`connect_two_daemons`,
//! real transport, real peer sessions) `collision_matrix.rs` already uses
//! for its own collision scenarios, rather than patched in place.
//!
//! The underlying hazard/collision machinery (`hazard.rs`,
//! `local_convergence.rs`) is unchanged and confirmed correct; only the
//! propagation these tests drive it through moves from a dead bare-session
//! pair to real `two_synced_devices` reconciliation. Kept in its own file
//! rather than folded into `collision_matrix.rs`: these five spin up a full
//! coordination server + two-daemon mesh each, same as every scenario in
//! that file, and appending them there was observed to push
//! `collision_matrix.rs`'s own `concurrent_edit_edit_keeps_both_copies_as_
//! original_plus_conflict_copy` (which depends on a tight ~30ms wall-clock
//! margin between two edits) past its margin under `--test-threads=4`
//! parallel load from the added tests sharing the same test binary -- a
//! real, reproduced side effect, not a hypothetical one. A separate `.rs`
//! file is a separate test binary, so it carries none of that shared
//! thread-pool contention.
//!
//! `TestDevice`/`setup_device`/`start_watching`/`two_synced_devices` are
//! intentionally duplicated from `collision_matrix.rs` rather than shared --
//! matches this codebase's existing convention of self-contained daemon
//! integration test binaries (see that file's own doc comment).
