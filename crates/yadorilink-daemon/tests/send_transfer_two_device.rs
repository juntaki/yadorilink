//! Track Send: real two-device send/receive over the real QUIC transport,
//! and a real crash-recovery test for `receive_transfer`'s resume logic.
//!
//! Deliberately does NOT call `link_eager`/`link_on_demand` on either
//! device, and registers both with the coordination fake with an EMPTY
//! group list -- proving Track Send needs no linked folder and no shared
//! folder group, per its own design constraint. `support::topology`'s
//! `new_node`/`FakeCoordination`/`spawn_orchestrator` are reused exactly as
//! every other real-transport daemon test uses them; this file adds
//! nothing to that harness beyond what Track Send itself needs
//! (`yadorilink_daemon::send_transfer::run`, started the same way
//! `app.rs` starts it in production, over each node's own isolated
//! config directory).
