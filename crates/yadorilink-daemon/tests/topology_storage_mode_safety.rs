//! M5-A Pass 6: safety-critical storage operations under faults, proven on
//! the real canonical N/M/W topology (real `peer_orchestrator`, real
//! transport, real control socket) composed with `storage_mode_
//! orchestration.rs`'s own established `wiremock` stand-in for
//! coordination-worker -- per this pass's own investigation (Phase 6.1):
//! the role-level demotion/unlink handoff gate in `replica_role_service.rs`
//! is the real, CURRENTLY-SHIPPED backend-authoritative safety operation
//! ("Unsafe eviction/local-copy removal is backend-gated"). The PER-FILE
//! block-reclaim custody path (`P2pCustodyConfirmer::confirms_present`,
//! `materialization_eviction::evict_file`'s physical-deletion half) is
//! feature-gated off in every build today
//! (`REMOTE_CUSTODY_LEASES_SUPPORTED = false` -- its own doc comment says
//! outright "this method is not actually reachable in any build today"),
//! so testing it end-to-end here would exercise dead code; it is already
//! covered at the unit level by `gc.rs`'s own
//! `eviction_without_remote_lease_never_reaches_physical_reclaim`, and is
//! out of scope for this pass until that feature actually ships.
//!
//! **Why compose two fakes, not one**: `FakeCoordination` (the netmap
//! WebSocket subscription) and coordination-worker's plain HTTP API are
//! genuinely separate production boundaries --
//! `DaemonHandoffReadinessAdapter`'s own doc comment states readiness
//! confirmation and lease acquisition go over the real peer-to-peer
//! session, NEVER coordination-worker's HTTP API, while the final
//! role-loss COMMIT (and a promotion's storage-mode write) genuinely does
//! go to coordination-worker over HTTP (`HttpRoleLossCoordination`). No new
//! unified fake is introduced; both existing fakes are simply pointed at
//! the same real topology nodes.
//!
//! **Why M must genuinely PROMOTE itself to Eager first**: `fake.set_full_
//! replica` only publishes what OTHER peers believe about a device over
//! the netmap -- it does not touch that device's own LOCAL materialization
//! policy. The real responder-side check
//! (`yadorilink_replica_engine::engine::holds_version_durably`, answering
//! an incoming `VersionPresentQuery`) requires the RESPONDER's OWN local
//! retention policy to already be `Eager` -- an on-demand device's cache is
//! transient and must never be trusted to authorize a peer dropping its own
//! only copy, no matter what the coordination plane claims about it. So
//! before N can ever demote, M must have genuinely, locally promoted itself
//! -- driven here through M's own real control-socket `set_storage_mode`
//! request (never a direct DB write), exactly the "exercise production
//! daemon APIs" requirement.
//!
//! **The TOCTOU seam**: `DaemonState::request_handoff_lease` (the
//! confirmed TARGET's own handling of an incoming P2P `HandoffLeaseRequest`)
//! already computes `attested_digest` (this device's root-set digest)
//! BEFORE calling coordination-worker's `/handoff/lease` route, then
//! re-derives `pinned_digest` via an atomic local pin AFTER that HTTP round
//! trip returns, and declines the lease if they differ -- a real,
//! already-existing production TOCTOU guard. `wiremock`'s own responder
//! closure for that route fires synchronously DURING the awaited HTTP call,
//! i.e. exactly inside that window -- the narrowest available test-only
//! hook to inject a genuine, real state change (a real `std::fs::write`)
//! between the safety read and the commit, with zero production code
//! touched.
