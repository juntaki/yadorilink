//! Regression coverage for the Convergence Engine scheduler: `run`'s own
//! loop used to sleep a
//! full tick interval (or wait on the coarse `MaterializationWake`
//! `Notify`) after every `run_once` call, REGARDLESS of whether that
//! call's own group-processing attempts left a large, immediately-runnable
//! backlog behind -- `MAX_PATHS_PER_RECONCILE_ATTEMPT` (32; see
//! `engine.rs`'s own doc comment on it) bounds one
//! ATTEMPT's worst-case latency, but nothing forced the scheduler to
//! actually rest once that attempt finished. `run_once`'s `RunOnceOutcome`/
//! `run`'s own `yield_now`-not-sleep decision is what this file exercises;
//! `run_once`'s live claim source is now `projection_obligations`, driven
//! through `process_group_via_obligations`, not the retired
//! `materialization_jobs` scheduler.
//!
//! **Scope note**: a fully hermetic, single-tick-precise test of
//! `process_group_via_obligations`'s own budget-selection boundary (e.g. "exactly one window of the
//! claimed jobs reach `Planning`, the rest are never touched at all")
//! would need either a real connected peer session constructed with no
//! concurrently-running background engine tick racing it, or a production
//! seam to inject a fake `candidate_sessions` result -- `DaemonState::new`
//! unconditionally starts `MaintenanceCoordinator` (which owns this exact
//! engine loop), and `DaemonState::build` (the maintenance-free
//! constructor) is `pub(crate)`, unreachable from this external
//! integration-test crate. This file's own tests are therefore built
//! around properties that stay deterministic even with that background
//! loop genuinely running alongside them -- a real, connected two-device
//! scenario, and a real, permanently-peerless one -- rather than
//! asserting exact per-tick job-table state.
