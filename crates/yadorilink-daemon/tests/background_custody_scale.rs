//! What a background cycle costs, measured rather than asserted about.
//!
//! The defect this design closes was a cost, not a correctness bug: the
//! background health check reused the action-time proof, so refreshing a
//! status indicator issued one round-trip and one whole-file re-read per
//! durability root, every ninety seconds. At eight thousand roots that is
//! eight thousand of each.
//!
//! So the thing to pin is the shape of the cost, not a wall-clock number. A
//! cycle's request count must not depend on how many roots a group has, and
//! must not depend on how many peers are connected multiplied by it.
//!
//! # Why the measuring tests hold a lock
//!
//! The counters `io_diag` and `custody_diag` keep are process-global — that
//! is what lets a benchmark read them from a running daemon without a seam
//! through every layer. Two tests measuring in the same process interleave
//! and both come out wrong, and the failure is not subtle: arming is global
//! too, so one test finishing disarms the counters under another that is
//! still running, and that one then measures a cycle as having asked
//! nothing.
//!
//! Which is exactly what happened here once a second measuring test was
//! added next to the first. So [`MEASURING`] makes the exclusion a fact
//! rather than a note: every test that reads a counter holds it for its
//! whole body. Nothing here may be written to run alongside anything else in
//! this file.
//!
//! # Why this one may run on a tmpfs and the write-path benchmark may not
//!
//! Everything asserted here is a COUNT: requests issued, block reads caused.
//! Counts do not depend on what filesystem the stores sit on, so the default
//! temporary directory is fine and the numbers mean the same thing anywhere.
//!
//! Its sibling `root_set_generation_write_cost` asserts a DURATION RATIO, and
//! that one refuses to run on a memory-backed filesystem, because the cost it
//! is about is a page write and a tmpfs has none. Keeping the distinction
//! explicit in both places is cheaper than rediscovering it.
//!
//! # The counters live on the peer that ANSWERS
//!
//! A custody query costs the responder a block read; the asker learns
//! nothing from its own question. Reading the asker's counters reports zero
//! for work that really happened, which looks exactly like a cycle that
//! verified nothing. Here both daemons are in one process, so one set of
//! counters covers both — but the assertions still say which side they are
//! about, because the day this becomes two processes that distinction is
//! the whole measurement.
