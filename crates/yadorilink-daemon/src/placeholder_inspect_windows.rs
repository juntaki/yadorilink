//! The daemon-process side of Windows CfAPI dirty detection --
//! `local_change.rs`'s ONLY way to prove a `Placeholder`-state path is
//! still untouched on Windows (see `ports::LocalMutationStore::
//! inspect_windows_placeholder`'s own doc for the exact contract this
//! module fulfils).
//!
//! # Why this calls `CfGetPlaceholderInfo` from the DAEMON process, not
//! `yadorilink-cfapi-host.exe`
//!
//! `shell-ext/windows/src/cfapi.rs`'s `fetch_data_callback` and this
//! module's own `inspect_placeholder` both end up calling into the Cloud
//! Filter API against the same on-disk placeholders, but from two
//! DIFFERENT OS processes. The filter driver refuses ordinary file
//! operations -- even a read-only attribute query -- against a
//! placeholder under a sync root with NO connected provider at all. It does not follow (and this
//! module does not assume) that the connection must belong to the SAME
//! process making the query: in production, `yadorilink-cfapi-host.exe`
//! is ALWAYS the connected provider for every registered root, so a
//! read-only query from a second process (this daemon) against a
//! placeholder under one of those already-connected roots is the bet this
//! module makes, instead of standing up a second cross-process RPC
//! surface (`daemon -> cfapi-host`) just to run this one read.
//!
//! This cross-process assumption is not exercised by this module's own
//! (non-Windows) tests. If it is wrong on real hardware, every `CfGetPlaceholderInfo`
//! call here would simply fail -- which this module already maps to
//! `PlaceholderStatus::Unknown`, the same fail-closed outcome as every
//! other failure mode it handles, so Windows dirty detection would
//! degrade to "always capture" (safe, if suboptimal) rather than produce
//! a wrong answer. Only in that failure case does the cross-process RPC
//! design (`cfapi-host` as a second named-pipe server, `daemon` as its
//! client) become worth the added complexity.
