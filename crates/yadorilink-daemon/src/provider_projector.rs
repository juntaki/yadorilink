//! The daemon-level task that projects provider groups.
//!
//! A provider root has no directory, so no link runtime ever starts for it and the engine's lanes
//! refuse it. This task is the only consumer of its group's projection obligations: for the
//! initial build of the namespace and for every later peer edit it writes the rows (and, through
//! the commit-time reconcile of the same transaction, the structural directories, the change
//! events and the content fence), then kicks the publication driver for what became pending. When
//! the initial build is complete and verified it marks the namespace queryable, which is what lets
//! the host register the domain.
//!
//! It polls for open obligations at a short interval instead of being woken by the admission:
//! the idle cost is one indexed existence probe per root, and no admission seam needs to know
//! about this task.
