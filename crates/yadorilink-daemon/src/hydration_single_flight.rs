//! M2-5: per-`(group_id, path)` single-flight coalescing for FETCH_DATA-
//! driven hydration -- the roadmap's own scope: "同一pathへの複数
//! FETCH_DATA -> hydrateはsingle-flight" (multiple concurrent FETCH_DATA
//! calls for the same path must single-flight, not each independently
//! re-fetch).
//!
//! `hydration.rs`'s existing per-path lock (`PathLockRegistry`, held for
//! `hydrate_inner`'s ENTIRE attempt -- see that call site's own doc
//! comment for the round-10 race it closes) already makes two concurrent
//! `hydrate` calls for the same path SERIALIZE: the second attempt cannot
//! start its own peer fetch until the first's finishes. What it does NOT
//! do is COALESCE them -- the second attempt, once it acquires the lock,
//! runs its own full `hydrate_inner` from scratch (a second, fully
//! redundant peer block fetch for content the first attempt just
//! materialized). Two apps opening the same file at once (or a retried
//! FETCH_DATA callback racing the original) doubles peer network load and
//! doubles the block-serve credit consumed, for zero benefit.
//!
//! This registry sits layered OUTSIDE `hydrate_inner`'s locking, in
//! `hydrate_with_timeout`, and does not change that function's internals
//! or its lock's scope at all: at most one caller per `(group_id, path)`
//! ever becomes the "leader" and actually calls `hydrate_inner`; every
//! other concurrent caller becomes a "follower" that simply awaits the
//! leader's eventual result instead of running its own attempt. The
//! leader's own path lock is therefore now provably uncontended in the
//! coalesced case -- this registry does not replace it, defense-in-depth
//! for any caller that arrives in a NEW round (after the previous
//! leader's round has already finished and this registry's entry for
//! that path has been removed).
