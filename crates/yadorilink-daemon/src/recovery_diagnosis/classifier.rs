//! Phase 2.1-C2-B2: a pure classifier that combines a local recovery
//! journal row's own state with Phase 2.1-C2-B1's evidence-identity
//! qualification into a [`RecoveryDiagnosis`] -- a
//! [`RecoveryRecommendation`] an operator, or a later phase's automatic
//! reconciler, can act on. No database, no HTTP client, no mutation: every
//! function here is a pure `local + remote -> diagnosis` mapping over
//! values already produced by earlier phases.
//!
//! The public entry points (`diagnose_enrollment`/`diagnose_membership`/
//! `diagnose_role_loss`) deliberately take only `local`/`remote` --
//! `qualification` is generated INSIDE, never accepted as a caller-supplied
//! parameter. A caller-supplied qualification could be built from a
//! DIFFERENT `local`/`remote` pair than the ones actually passed in,
//! producing a diagnosis that describes an evidence combination that never
//! existed.
