//! Owner operations for eviction to a placeholder and for recovery: the

//!
//! Eviction, the repair sweep and restore-journal recovery live in
//! `yadorilink-filesystem-sync` and reach this state only through
//! `MaterializationExecutionPort`, whose implementation delegates each
//! semantic method here. They run under the port's error type: every step
//! maps its storage error exactly as the port adapter it replaced did, so
//! what a lane sees and logs is unchanged. The physical writes, and every
//! disk comparison a decision depends on (the byte, target, mode and xattr
//! checks), stay in the lane. The one disk read here is the reconstruct
//! and symlink-rebuild settles' observation of the identity now at
//! `out_path`, after the lane's write, to name that object in the proof
//! they publish.
