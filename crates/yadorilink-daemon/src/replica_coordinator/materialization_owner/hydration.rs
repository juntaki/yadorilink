//! Owner operations for hydration: the one version-bound guard every hydration attempt holds
//! (`HydrationAttempt`) and the judgement of what an attempt found at its path when it started
//! (`admit_hydration_start`).
//!
//! The guard is armed by the entry CAS to `Hydrating`, bound to the attempt's version, and
//! reverts the row on drop unless the attempt published. The lane keeps every fetch, check and
//! physical write between these steps. Which lane runs (the on-access hydration, the background
//! convergence rehydration) changes how it fetches and writes, not what the guard guarantees.
