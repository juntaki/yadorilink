//! What a test can observe about, and impose on, a real
//! `ReplicaCoordinator` -- the four things `FakeReplicaState` used to
//! provide by standing in for it.
//!
//! Compiled under `#[cfg(test)]` only, so none of this exists in a
//! production build: not the fields, not the calls that touch them. It
//! lives on the real coordinator rather than on a double because the
//! subject under test is a `LocalConvergenceExecutor` driving real
//! storage, and a double that answers differently from the database is
//! how a test passes over the difference.
//!
//! The four are not interchangeable and none of them is expressible as
//! "assert the final state":
//!
//! - **Call counts.** The zero-write assertions are about work *not*
//!   done. A path that is already settled must perform no metadata
//!   apply, no projected-row write and no authoring-hash write -- and a
//!   final-state check cannot tell "wrote nothing" apart from "wrote the
//!   same value again", which is precisely the regression these guard.
//! - **Batch shapes.** Recording one entry per call, holding that call's
//!   block hashes, is what makes "these hashes were written in ONE call"
//!   distinguishable from "these hashes were written in N calls". The
//!   resulting rows are identical either way.
//! - **Failure injection.** A batch commit's transaction has to be made
//!   to fail on demand to assert that the whole call errors rather than
//!   reporting some paths settled; nothing a test can do to real storage
//!   fails exactly that transaction and nothing else.
//! - **Deterministic interleave.** A supersession has to land *inside*
//!   another operation's read window. Racing it from a thread makes the
//!   test flaky; firing it from the read itself makes it exact.
