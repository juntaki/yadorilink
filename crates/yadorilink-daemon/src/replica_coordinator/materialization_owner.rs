//! Owner-side materialization-semantic operations.
//!
//! A lane (eager, on-demand, symlink, tombstone, engine completion, ...)
//! used to compose the raw primitives -- open an intent, persist a row, set
//! a materialization state, clear or set the held marker, bump the
//! mutation fence, publish or complete -- itself, each in its own order.
//! Each method here is ONE protocol's exact raw-call sequence (or one half
//! of it: the "open" steps before a physical write, or the "settle" steps
//! after it), moved here unchanged, so the lane calls the semantic step
//! instead of the raw steps.
//!
//! Every method keeps the transaction boundaries it replaced: each raw step
//! is still its own transaction, in the same order, with the same checks
//! and early returns. No method takes a path lock (the caller holds it) or
//! performs a physical write (the lane keeps it, between an open and a
//! settle). `scripts/check-materialization-semantic-boundary.py` pins every
//! raw call that remains, here and in the lanes.
