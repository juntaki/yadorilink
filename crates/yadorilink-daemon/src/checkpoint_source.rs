//! The daemon-side half
//! of checkpoint issuance — collecting a group's pending (uncheckpointed)
//! native deltas into a batch, requesting a signed `AuthorizationCheckpoint`
//! for it, and attaching the result locally so `published_view`'s
//! functions start reporting those deltas as published.
//!
//! A trait so tests can supply a fake without any network dependency, and
//! a thin production implementation wrapping
//! `coordination_client::request_authorization_checkpoint`.
//!
//! Wired into the daemon's reconnect event loop by
//! `peer_orchestrator.rs::spawn_flush_pending_checkpoints_on_reconnect` and
//! surfaced by `connection_trace.rs`'s `checkpoint_pending` doctor
//! category. This is the ONLY local-publication path —
//! there is no second way for a locally authored Change to become
//! `Published`.
