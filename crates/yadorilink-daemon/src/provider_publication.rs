//! The publication state machine of a provider root (design 2.1 and 2.2).
//!
//! When the CONTENT of an item the OS may hold changes, the new version must not reach the OS
//! while its old bytes can still be read from cache. So: the fence is ON from the commit (it is
//! DERIVED: the published version differs from the current one and the content differs, see
//! `ProviderRepository::publication`), the OS's old copy is evicted, and only after that is the
//! new version signalled; the daemon then records it as published and the fence is OFF. A
//! metadata-only change is signalled without any eviction.
//!
//! Nothing about progress is stored: every step is idempotent and starts again from the
//! committed rows (evict again, which answers NOT_MATERIALIZED when already dataless, then
//! signal again). So a crash, a restart, a reconnect of the host and a lost acknowledgement are
//! all the same thing: run the pass again.
//!
//! An item the OS keeps open (EBUSY) is retried alone, with backoff, by its own task. No lock
//! of any kind is held across a retry or an acknowledgement wait, a bounded number of evict
//! requests are in flight per root, and nothing waits for another item: a pile of busy items
//! blocks neither the other items, nor the root, nor a sync commit. Nothing forces the update.
//!
//! Published state that cannot be resolved is lost evidence (invariant I2): the root is
//! rebootstrapped with a new `root_id`, never repaired by assuming the OS holds the current
//! version.
