//! Opt-in: record which carriers a daemon's transfers actually used.
//!
//! A benchmark that reports a transfer rate is making a claim about a path,
//! and from outside the process there is no way to check it. The daemon knows
//! -- every link it dials can be watched -- but nothing carried that knowledge
//! out, so a harness could observe only that bytes arrived, not how.
//!
//! This writes the answer to a file named by `YADORILINK_PATH_WITNESS_PATH`.
//! Absent that variable the whole thing is inert: no hook, no watchers, no
//! file. It is measurement apparatus, not a feature.
//!
//! # Why installation is not a request that arrives later
//!
//! The hook is installed between the sync stack starting and the
//! reconciliation driver starting, and that placement is the whole design.
//!
//! A "begin witnessing now" control message would be simpler and would be
//! wrong. `SyncStack::link_to` hands back a cached link without dialling when
//! one is already alive, so a hook installed after any link exists never sees
//! that link -- and the bytes crossing it would be invisible to a measurement
//! that believed it was watching everything. The window between the stack
//! existing and the driver running is the last moment at which no link can yet
//! have been opened, so installing there is what makes "every connection" true
//! rather than merely likely.
//!
//! A run therefore has to start from a cold daemon. That is a constraint on
//! the harness, and a cheap one next to a number nobody can defend.
//!
//! # What the report actually covers
//!
//! Not "every connection this daemon ever had". Precisely: every connection
//! the transfer used between the cold start and the seal taken at shutdown.
//!
//! The difference is a race that is real and does not matter here. `flush`
//! reads whether anything arrived late and then writes the file, so a dial
//! landing between those two steps is missed. It cannot make the report
//! wrong for a measurement shaped like the canary's, because the seal is
//! taken during a shutdown begun only after the transfer was confirmed
//! complete from outside -- and a connection established after that point
//! cannot retroactively have carried a payload that had already arrived. The
//! hook also runs after the connection exists but before its first lane, so
//! an unwatched connection cannot have moved anything earlier either.
//!
//! Enumerating every connection up to process exit would mean stopping the
//! driver before taking the verdict. That is a heavier shutdown ordering
//! than any measurement here needs, so it is deliberately not done.
