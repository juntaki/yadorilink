//! `MaterializeToTemp`: the extension asks for the CURRENT version's bytes of one provider item.
//!
//! The same hydration primitive as the on-access path runs with a temp sink: the bytes are
//! assembled in the daemon's staging directory, verified and fsynced, renamed into the handoff
//! directory, and only then is the response (carrying just the handoff name) sent. After the
//! response went out, the handoff is recorded in the evidence ledger and a sweep is scheduled for
//! a file the OS never took. A request whose version moved, whose item has a publication pending,
//! or whose root is not ready fails with the matching reason and never returns old bytes.
//!
//! A request runs as its own task so a cancel for its `request_id` (or the connection closing)
//! can abort it: the assembly removes its own temp file when dropped, the guarded row reverts, and
//! nothing between the final rename and the response awaits, so an abort can never leave a named
//! file behind.
