//! This crate's binding to the one credential store.
//!
//! This module used to be an eleven-line copy of `yadorilink-cli`'s
//! `token_store.rs` that read the access token the CLI had written. Two
//! implementations of one contract is one too many, and the contract itself
//! was wrong: an access token lives five minutes
//! (`coordination-worker/src/auth/provider/config.ts`), so a daemon that reads
//! one at startup is authenticated until its first coffee break.
//!
//! The store is now [`yadorilink_fapi_client::store`] and the thing that keeps
//! a daemon authenticated is [`yadorilink_fapi_client::CredentialManager`],
//! which holds the access token in memory and refreshes it before it dies.
//! What is left here is the binding: which directory this process's
//! credentials live in.
//!
//! # The daemon holds a credential, not a token
//!
//! `app.rs` used to read one access token here at startup and hand copies of
//! it to the coordination client, the netmap subscriber and the NAT prober.
//! That is gone. [`coordination_auth`] returns a
//! [`yadorilink_fapi_client::CoordinationAuth`] built over one shared
//! [`yadorilink_fapi_client::CredentialManager`], and every subsystem holds a
//! clone of it -- an `Arc`, so all of them refresh through the same in-memory
//! cache and the same cross-process rotation lock rather than each rotating
//! the stored refresh token on its own. A refresh-token replay is not a
//! harmless 400: it fires the server's reuse defence and takes the whole grant
//! family down.

/// which is a supported state; what it never does is reach the coordination
/// plane by some other means.

/// A store that cannot be READ is an error rather than a `None`, because the
/// two mean opposite things and only one of them is a user who has not signed

/// One credential manager, built once here and shared by every subsystem,
/// which refreshes the five-minute access token on its own and mints a DPoP
/// proof per request.
///
/// Building the manager reaches the network once, for discovery. That is
/// deliberate and it happens at startup rather than at first use: a daemon
/// whose stored credential belongs to a different deployment, or whose
/// registration has been revoked, should say so while someone is still looking
/// at it.
///
/// # A network that is simply down is not a misconfiguration
///
/// That startup fetch used to be the only way to a manager, which made an
/// unreachable Authorization Server fatal: the `?` here left `app::run` and
/// the process exited. A daemon on a machine whose internet is out would
/// therefore not start at all -- including on the local network, where its
/// already-authorized peers were sitting reachable the whole time. So the
/// document this device last fetched is kept
/// ([`remember_discovery_document`]) and used when, and only when, the fetch
/// fails at the transport (`reqwest`) layer: nothing was reached, so nothing
/// was learned that could contradict it.
///
/// Every OTHER failure is still fatal, which is what keeps the check above
/// meaningful: a server that answers with an error status, a document that
/// no longer meets the profile, and an issuer that disagrees with the stored
/// credential are all cases where the server WAS reached and said something,
/// and none of them is a network outage to ride out.
