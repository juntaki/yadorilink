//! The Convergence Engine's scheduler loop: claims every currently-runnable
//! `projection_obligations` row (bumped by DAG admission — `dag_store::
//! admit_change`/`admit_prepared_emission` — not enqueued by `PeerSyncSession
//! ::handle_change_batch`, which no longer schedules anything at all) and
//! drives them to completion on its own schedule, using the SAME
//! `reconcile_local_materialization_audit` / `reconcile_group_paths` /
//! `materialize` machinery this codebase already had and already tests --
//! this engine only changes *when*, *from where*, and *off which claim
//! source* that machinery runs, not what it does internally.
//!
//! `projection_obligations` has no in-flight state at all: claiming
//! (`dag_claim_runnable_obligations`) is a plain read, never a claim-and-mark
//! transition, so unlike the retired job-table scheduler this needs no
//! stale-active-processing reclaim at startup or on a same-process failure
//! between claim and completion -- there is nothing to go stale in the
//! first place. Completion is one atomic (G, E, durable-proof) decision per
//! path (`complete_one_obligation`/`complete_zero_work_obligation`), and
//! retry/backoff (`dag_mark_obligation_attempt_failed`/`dag_defer_
//! obligation_without_penalty`) is obligation-native, not modeled on a
//! separate job-state machine.
//!
//! Every SQLite call this file makes is synchronous and blocks the calling
//! thread (`yadorilink-sqlite-runtime` has no async surface at all, by
//! design), and several of them are per-path loops over a claimed batch of up
//! to `MAX_JOBS_PER_TICK_PER_GROUP` rows. This is a `spawn_restarting` async
//! task, so every one of them goes through `run_blocking_sweep_offloaded` --
//! the crate's shared `block_in_place`-when-multi-threaded guard -- rather
//! than running on the worker that polls the tick. `pool.rs`'s own contract
//! states the requirement outright: an async caller must do the wrapping on
//! its own side, because the SQLite layer has no runtime to yield to.
