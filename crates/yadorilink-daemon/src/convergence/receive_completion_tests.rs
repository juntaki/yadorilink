#![cfg(test)]

//! A received file's proof and its obligation's completion, driven by the
//! real obligation engine on a running link.
//!
//! The content write commits its proof, its `Present` stamp, its intent
//! clear and its obligation's completion in one transaction, after the bytes
//! are durable. These tests park the worker at exactly that seam -- the temp
//! file synced, renamed and its directory synced; nothing committed yet --
//! and land a competing mutation, or a crash, there:
//!
//! - a fence moved there (a capture, a local edit) publishes nothing and
//!   leaves the obligation open under the claim it had;
//! - a claim overtaken there (a newer admission or a re-arm of the same
//!   path's obligation) keeps the proof, which is still exactly true, and
//!   leaves the obligation open for a later claim to close without work;
//! - a crash there leaves the intent and the obligation open over bytes
//!   that are already right, which repair and the next pass finish
//!   without rewriting anything;
//! - a crash after the commit leaves nothing for either to do.
