/// obligation claim cycle (a live candidate peer, not this sweep) produces

///
/// This deliberately does NOT drive a reconcile attempt the way the
/// hazard-recheck sweep does: gating re-arm on
/// `ProjectionAttempt::is_settled(path)` after running reconciliation
/// with no way to obtain content at all would stall permanently. A path whose content
/// requires an actual block fetch (anything but the trivial empty-content
/// case) could never `is_settled` on such a pass, so it could never
/// re-arm at all: an unignored file needing real content would stay
/// `'ignore_blocked'` forever, invisible to the production scheduler
/// (which only ever claims `'pending'` rows). Reproducing that needs a
/// `FileVersion` with a real (non-empty) block absent from the local store
/// -- `empty_version()` is trivially "materializable" with no blocks at
/// all and so never exercises the ChannelClosed path. This function has
/// no dependency on full settlement at all: whether a path is still ignored is a pure,
/// local, synchronous policy question that has nothing to do with whether
/// its content can currently be fetched.
///
/// This deliberately avoids `state.local_retirement_session` (a real
/// `PeerSyncSession`, previously used only for its
/// `is_path_locally_ignored` accessor): that session's own first-ever
/// construction for a group triggers `NetmapChangeAuthenticator::new` ->
/// `validate_linked_history_best_effort`, which can transiently quarantine
/// every OTHER already-connected session's authorization for this group if
/// that validation is not yet available (see
/// `process_group_via_obligations`'s doc comment). Whether a path is
/// locally ignored has nothing to do with peer/session state at all --
/// this pass loads the group's `EffectiveIgnoreSet` directly from its sync
/// root, the same source `PeerSyncSession::effective_ignore_set` reads
/// from, without ever constructing a session. Unlike that session-cached
/// accessor, this has no last-known-good fallback: a transient sync-root
/// resolution failure re-arms rather than leaving the path parked, which
/// is safe (the ordinary claim cycle re-evaluates ignore policy again
/// downstream) and strictly better than risking the quarantine side effect.
