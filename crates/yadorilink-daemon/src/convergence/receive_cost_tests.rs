#![cfg(test)]

//! MEASUREMENT GUARD, not a semantic test: how many SQLite write
//! transactions receiving one file costs on a running link, driven by the
//! real obligation engine. Every outer write transaction is one WAL commit,
//! so this is the per-path durability cost the receive path pays before any
//! file byte is counted.
//!
//! The assertion is an upper bound with room to spare, so a later change
//! that folds more of these commits together keeps passing; the exact count
//! is printed for whoever is measuring. Whether a received file is correct
//! is the business of the semantic tests, never of this one.
//!
//! Content-carrying versions have their blocks put into the local store and
//! recorded as this group's (`record_block_provenance`), as a completed
//! fetch leaves them. A block that is only physically present does not count
//! as the group's, so without that record the eager lane asks the fixture's
//! peer for it, and that peer never answers: the attempt then waits out the
//! bulk fetch timeout instead of projecting.
