//! This crate's entire contribution to peer-applied mutation ("ApplyPeerChange").
//!
//! The actual mutation logic -- `materialize`, `hydrate`, `hold`, and the
//! rest of what happens when a peer's change is applied -- lives in
//! `yadorilink_peer_session::peer_session::PeerSyncSession`, a different crate
//! this one depends on (never the reverse). That is a deliberate boundary,
//! not a gap: `yadorilink-daemon` has no way to reach back into
//! `yadorilink-sync-core` to inject dispatch logic without inverting the
//! dependency graph, so "ApplyPeerChange" cannot be a daemon-owned operation
//! module the way `link_runtime::operations::capture_local_change`/
//! `repair_materialization` are.
//!
//! What this crate DOES own is the authority lookup `PeerSyncSession` calls
//! through its injected `RootCommitAuthorityProvider` seam: resolving a
//! `group_id` to the SAME per-link `RootLease` every other subsystem
//! touching that link (local-change capture, periodic/startup repair, the
//! disk-reconcile backstop) admits through, not a second independent one.
//! `PeerSyncSession` fails closed (`SyncError::NotFound`) when this returns
//! `None` -- no live link, no provider installed, or (in production) the
//! link is only `Starting`, not yet `Ready` -- never a permissive fallback.
//!
//! Lives at the crate's top level, a sibling of `link_runtime` rather than
//! inside it: unlike that module tree's own operations, this impl is
//! `DaemonState`'s own (it needs the daemon-wide link table and runtime
//! registry directly, not a narrowed per-link bundle), so it stays out of
//! `link_runtime`'s own DaemonState-free module tree.
