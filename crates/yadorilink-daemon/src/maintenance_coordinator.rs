//! Owns spawning every one of this daemon's periodic background
//! maintenance tasks: the update-check scheduler, the pending-report retry
//! sweep, materialization repair, the Convergence Engine's own scheduler
//! loop, forward-rebroadcast, degraded-link recheck, retention expiry,
//! membership recovery, the disk-reconcile backstop, and the idle-triggered
//! GC scheduler.
//!
//! This module holds the SPAWNING CODE, kept out of `DaemonState::new`'s
//! own body -- `DaemonState::new` calls `start` as a single line. The
//! CALL SITE itself stays inside `new` (not in `app.rs`/`DaemonContext`
//! after construction returns):
//! `forward_rx` (the local `mpsc::Receiver` half of the change-forwarding
//! channel `new` constructs) is consumed directly by one of these tasks
//! and isn't stored anywhere on `DaemonState`, so moving the call site out
//! of `new` would require either widening `DaemonState::new`'s own return
//! type or storing `forward_rx` behind an `Option`/`Mutex` purely to hand
//! it back out again -- a real signature change touching every one of
//! `DaemonState::new`'s call sites (production and every test in this
//! crate) for no behavioral gain.
//!
//! Most of these tasks are named job types under `crate::maintenance`,
//! each with a `run_once` method holding the sweep/check logic. This module's own remaining job is
//! exactly what its name says: construct each job (deriving its narrow
//! dependencies from `state`), then spawn a small loop per job that calls
//! `run_once` -- every loop-shape/interval/supervision-strategy choice
//! below (`spawn_logged` vs `spawn_restarting`, which jobs run once
//! immediately at startup, which don't) lives here; the sweep bodies live
//! in their own files.
//! `#4` (`convergence-engine-scheduler`) and `#5` (`forward-rebroadcast`)
//! are untouched -- see each one's own comment below for why.
//!
//! No queue unification, no `ConvergenceWork` enum, no priority
//! scheduling, no dedup, no event-driven enqueue -- every task below keeps
//! its own independent spawn, own interval, own supervision strategy
//! (`spawn_logged` vs `spawn_restarting`), completely unchanged.
