//! The `ReplicaCoordinator`-backed peer-session integration fixture.
//!
//! It lived in `yadorilink-peer-session`'s own `tests/peer_session.rs` until
//! the tests whose subject is materialization, hydration and convergence moved
//! to this crate. The fixture could not follow them by being copied -- two
//! copies of a 200-line mini-replica drift, and a fix lands on one side only --
//! and it could not stay behind either, because `Device` is a
//! `ReplicaCoordinator`, a link row, a `VerifiedRoot`, a startup gate, a DAG
//! and a self-signing checkpoint author: this crate's subject, not
//! peer-session's.
//!
//! So it lives here, and peer-session's remaining integration tests reach it
//! through the dev-dependency on this crate they already had. That back-edge
//! is a test-harness bridge and not the end state: once the tests that stayed
//! behind no longer need a daemon-built session, the edge and this module's
//! peer-session half can both go.
