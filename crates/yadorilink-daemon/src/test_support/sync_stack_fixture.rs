//! The two-device assembly every stack-level scenario starts from.
//!
//! A device here is the real thing: a `ReplicaCoordinator`, a
//! `SegmentBlockStore`, a `DaemonState`, a device signing key, and a netmap
//! entry pinning its peer. What the fixture stands in for is the *policy
//! chain* -- the verified group policy a real daemon would have received --
//! because reproducing one is a separate subject with its own tests, and
//! every group would otherwise resolve to `Withhold` the moment a netmap
//! named a writer for it.
//!
//! # Why this is not in `sync_adapter`
//!
//! It was, as `#[cfg(test)]` helpers beside the tests that first needed
//! them. `#[cfg(test)]` is crate-local: a test *binary* under `tests/`
//! compiles against this crate as an ordinary library, with `cfg(test)` off,
//! and so could not see them. That is why the stack-level partition scenario
//! had to live inside `src/` -- not because it belonged there, but because
//! its fixtures did.
//!
//! Gated `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]`, so this is not
//! production API: the only callers that can reach it are this crate's own
//! unit tests and a dependant that asked for the feature. This crate is
//! already its own dev-dependency with `test-support` on, so its integration
//! binaries get it without any further arrangement.
//!
//! # The authority key
//!
//! `authority_key` and `GROUP` live here rather than being borrowed from a
//! test module, because [`FixtureCheckpointSource`] and
//! [`honest_bundle_carrying`] have to agree on both or nothing verifies.
