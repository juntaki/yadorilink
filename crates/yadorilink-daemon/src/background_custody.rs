//! What the background health check learns, and what it is not allowed to
//! be mistaken for.
//!
//! Every ninety seconds this daemon would like to know whether each folder
//! group's data still exists somewhere other than here. Until this module
//! existed it found out by running the action-time handoff proof: one
//! round-trip per durability root, each one making the peer read that
//! version's blocks back off its own disk and re-hash them. On a two-device
//! group with eight thousand roots that was eight thousand round-trips and
//! eight thousand whole-file re-reads, per group, per sweep — to refresh an
//! indicator in a status listing.
//!
//! The cost was not the verification. The verification is right, and an
//! unlink still runs all of it. The cost was that a *monitor* was reusing a
//! *proof*, and the only thing stopping that was that nobody had noticed.
//!
//! So the two facts are now two types. [`BackgroundCustodyEvidence`] is what
//! a monitor can afford to learn continuously;
//! [`crate::handoff_proof::StrongHandoffProof`] is what a destructive action
//! must establish afresh. Neither converts to the other, the cache holds
//! only the first, and the architecture manifest refuses a build in which
//! the background path can reach for the second.

/// What one background custody cycle established about a group.
///
/// # `Corroborated` means, precisely
///
/// At the moment this value was made, one named peer:
///
/// 1. was connected, and was a netmap-authorized full-replica writer for
///    the group both before and after the round-trip, across an unchanged
///    local membership generation;
/// 2. reported itself `Eager` for the group — the same precondition the
///    handoff responder checks first, because an on-demand device may evict
///    at any moment;
/// 3. reported every one of its current rows for the group materialized,
///    which is what separates a peer that holds the content from one that
///    has merely projected the changes describing it;
/// 4. returned a **current-state** digest equal to this device's own, over
///    the same rows and by the same function — and this device's own had
///    not moved across the round-trip either.
///
/// # Why the current state and not the whole root set
///
/// Because the whole root set does not converge, and requiring it to would
/// have made the most ordinary two-device folder permanently
/// uncorroborated. A device that links a group it did not originate starts
/// from a local history floor and never reconstructs what came before it;
/// retention keeps any version inside its count bound indefinitely, whatever
/// its age. Two entirely honest eager replicas therefore retain different
/// history, forever, and there is no mechanism that would bring them
/// together.
///
/// `roots_digest_matched` records when the fuller agreement happens anyway.
/// It is an observation, never a condition. The whole root set is still
/// covered where it matters: by the handoff proof, at the moment something
/// irreversible is about to happen to it.
///
/// # What it does not mean
///
/// It says nothing about whether a single block exists on that peer's disk,
/// and nothing about whether any block it holds is intact. It does not
/// establish that the peer would actually serve those blocks — serving
/// authorization is per-group block provenance, which the handoff proof
/// checks and this does not. It is an index-level claim the peer makes
/// about itself, and it is worth exactly what that peer is worth.
///
/// That gap is deliberate and is not closed here. It is closed at the two
/// places where it matters: immediately before a destructive action, by a
/// fresh [`crate::handoff_proof::StrongHandoffProof`] that reads every byte
/// back; and, for latent corruption discovered at rest rather than at
/// decision time, by a budgeted scrub on a cadence measured in days rather
/// than in seconds. Asking a ninety-second monitor to answer the bit-rot
/// question is how the original defect came about.
