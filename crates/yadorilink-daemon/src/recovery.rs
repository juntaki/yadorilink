//! A read-only inventory over every in-flight local recovery
//! journal -- `enrollment_operations`, `membership_operations`, and
//! `role_loss_operations` -- normalized into one common shape an operator
//! (or the CLI's `recovery list`/`recovery show`) can read without knowing
//! each domain's own row schema. This module is strictly observational.
//! Nothing here writes to any table, retries a remote call, or changes a
//! row's state -- it only reads and decodes. Diagnosis against remote
//! (Worker) evidence (`crate::recovery_diagnosis`) and any write-side
//! resolution are deliberately not part of this module. Each domain keeps its own
//! strict decoder
//! (`ReplicaCoordinator::enrollment_repository().scan_all_enrollment_operations()`,
//! `ReplicaCoordinator::membership_operation_repository().scan_membership_operations_in_states()`,
//! `ReplicaCoordinator::role_loss_operation_repository().scan_all_role_loss_operations()`)
//! rather than this module decoding raw SQL rows itself: a single
//! `UNION`-style query across three differently-shaped tables would either
//! lose each domain's own shape validation (see e.g.
//! `validate_enrollment_operation`, `validate_membership_operation_shape`)
//! or have to reimplement it here, duplicating the exact rules each
//! table's own module already encodes. One malformed row in ANY domain is
//! isolated into [`RecoveryInventory::invalid`] rather than failing the
//! whole inventory -- an operator investigating a stuck membership
//! operation must never be blocked by an unrelated corrupt enrollment row,
//! and vice versa. Only an outright database read failure (a lock, a
//! missing table, an I/O error) fails the whole call; that is a
//! `SyncError`, not a per-row concern.
