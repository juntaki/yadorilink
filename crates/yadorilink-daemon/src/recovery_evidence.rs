//! Read-only remote-evidence lookups the daemon uses to
//! diagnose a stuck local recovery-journal operation against the
//! coordination plane's own durable state.
//!
//! This module is strictly read-only, structurally: [`RecoveryEvidenceSource`]
//! carries no mutation method at all. A diagnosis engine (`crate::recovery_diagnosis`)
//! built only against this trait cannot retry, cancel, or otherwise change
//! coordination-plane state no matter what it concludes -- write-side
//! resolution needs a separate capability entirely, not an
//! extension of this one.

/// The outcome of a single remote-evidence lookup.
///
/// `RecordNotFound` means ONLY that no durable operation record was
/// returned for this operation id at lookup time (a genuine HTTP 404). It
/// does NOT prove that:
/// - the request was definitely rejected;
/// - no historical mutation occurred (a role-loss commit made before
///   `role_loss_operation_receipts` existed leaves no receipt at all, and
///   even after that table exists, an enrollment/membership row whose own
///   endpoint never distinguishes "genuinely rejected" from "never
///   attempted" -- see each Worker route's own doc comment -- looks
///   identical here too);
/// - deleting the local journal, or otherwise treating this operation as
///   resolved, is safe.
///
/// Domain-specific diagnosis (`crate::recovery_diagnosis`) decides whether the same
/// request should be retried or whether additional evidence is required --
/// this type only reports what the lookup itself observed, nothing more.
///
/// The three-way split (as opposed to a plain `Option`) is what makes that
/// downstream diagnosis possible at all: a caller MUST be able to tell "the
/// coordination plane returned nothing for this id" (`RecordNotFound`)
/// apart from "the coordination plane could not be asked right now"
/// (`Unavailable`) -- collapsing the two, as an early draft of the
/// `role_loss_operation_receipts` write path itself briefly did in reverse
/// (treating a post-hoc state re-check as proof of success -- see that
/// fix's own doc comment in `coordination-worker/src/db/queries.ts`), is
/// exactly the class of bug this type exists to make impossible to write
/// by accident: nothing in this enum can be constructed by silently
/// downgrading `Unavailable` into `RecordNotFound`.
