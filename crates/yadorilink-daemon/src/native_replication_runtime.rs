//! Native replication in the live daemon: which peers get a native-replication
//! connection, what each connection may see, and when new local deltas are
//! published and pushed. The protocol logic is in
//! [`crate::native_replication_session`] and the byte-moving in
//! [`crate::native_replication_driver`]; this module binds them to
//! [`DaemonState`] (peer sessions, group authority, keys) and to the
//! endpoint's connections.
//!
//! One connection per peer pair: the device with the smaller endpoint id
//! dials, the other only accepts, so two dials never cross. A connection
//! lives as long as the peer's sync session; it serves the peer's requests
//! and reconciles on attach and on an interval, and new local deltas are
//! pushed the moment they are published.
