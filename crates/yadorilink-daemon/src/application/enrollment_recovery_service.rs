//! Crash-safety reconciliation for the create/join pending-enrollment
//! sagas -- the recovery counterpart to `EnrollmentService`'s own
//! synchronous create/join flow. Two distinct sweeps, run together every
//! call to [`EnrollmentRecoveryService::reconcile_once`]:
//!
//! - **Marker reconciliation** (`reconcile_markers`): a durable local
//!   marker records a local link whose local commit landed but whose
//!   matching coordination-plane activation was never confirmed -- the
//!   crash-safety net for a process killed in that exact window. See the
//!   coordination plane's own explicit Pending -> Active enrollment
//!   protocol this reconciles against: a create/join authorizes a Pending
//!   group/membership there BEFORE the local link is known to exist, and
//!   only `activate` turns it into a real, counted enrollment.
//! - **Journal reconciliation** (`reconcile_operations`): retries every
//!   other stuck `enrollment_operations` state (`PreparePending`,
//!   `Prepared`, `LocalSetupPending`, `CancelPending`) that has no other
//!   durable backstop.
//!
//! `app.rs` owns WHEN this runs (startup + a fixed interval); this service
//! owns WHAT recovery actually does.
