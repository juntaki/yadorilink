//! The single entry point the control socket calls into `application`
//! through. Built exactly once by the production composition root, and
//! handed down through `ControlContext`.
//!
//! Two kinds of field live here. A `*Service` field wraps a ports-based
//! application service that owns real saga/decision logic (validation,
//! sequencing, rollback, error translation). A `dyn *Port` field is a
//! command surface whose only application-level behaviour would be a 1:1
//! forward to that port, so callers reach the port directly instead of
//! through an extra wrapper type that adds nothing.
