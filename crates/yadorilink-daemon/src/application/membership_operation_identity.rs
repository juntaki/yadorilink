//! The canonical translation from a local `membership_operations` journal
//! row to the exact request shape the coordination plane's own lookup
//! (`GET /devices/membership-operations/:operationId`) reports back as
//! `record.request` -- shared by every caller that needs to compare a
//! journal row's identity against a remote record: the existing
//! reconcilers in `replica_membership_service.rs`, and Phase 2.1-C2-B's
//! evidence-identity qualification (the recovery-diagnosis module). A single
//! shared implementation means both stay in agreement by construction --
//! two independently-maintained canonicalizations could silently drift
//! apart, making one caller settle an operation the other would have
//! flagged as a mismatch.
