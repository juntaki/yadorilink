//! Replica-role's own ports -- what `ReplicaRoleService` needs from durable
//! storage, an established peer session, the coordination plane, and the
//! local link-watcher runtime, expressed as `dyn`-safe traits. Split into
//! five narrow ports rather than one wide one, mirroring Membership's own
//! split: each has an independent reason to vary (a fake lease port for
//! readiness-gate tests never needs a fake link-watcher runtime too).
