//! What `LinkLifecycleService` needs to atomically register a link. Split
//! into two ports matching the two concerns the daemon's original
//! `link` handler body bundled: `LinkRepositoryPort` for the durable `SyncState`
//! reads/writes (each method here is one atomic `SyncState` operation,
//! never decomposed further -- a transactional commit/rollback stays one
//! port call, never split across two so a caller could interleave other
//! work in between), and `LinkWatcherPort` for the in-memory watcher/
//! on-demand-materialization setup that runs after the commit.
//!
//! This is the single local-link commit path both the plain `yadorilink
//! link` command and `EnrollmentService::create_and_link`/`join_and_link`
//! (via `EnrollmentLinkPort`) converge on -- there is no second,
//! independent way to create a link row in this daemon.
