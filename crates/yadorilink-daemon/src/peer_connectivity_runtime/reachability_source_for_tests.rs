//! The one place a test makes a peer's connection state change the way the
//! running daemon would, without dialling anything.
//!
//! Each function feeds the connectivity runtime exactly the reports the iroh
//! endpoint gives it at that moment of a connection's life -- a dial starting
//! or failing, a connection coming up over a path, a connection closing --
//! through the same entry points the endpoint's observer and connection
//! followers call. A test driven through here therefore sees what production
//! derives from those reports, never a hand-assembled reachability value.
//!
//! Tests that pin what `yadorilink status`, the health count and fetch
//! availability MEAN for a peer go through this module rather than writing a
//! reachability directly, so they keep asserting the same meaning whatever
//! feeds it.
