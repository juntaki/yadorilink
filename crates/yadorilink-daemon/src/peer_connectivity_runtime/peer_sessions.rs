//! One `PeerSyncSession` per peer that is authorized and reachable over the

//! ```text
//!   pinned in PeerAuthorityState ──┐
//!                                  ├──► session registered in DaemonState.peers
//!   live iroh connection to it   ──┘        (lanes served, hydration and
//!                                            repair candidate, convergence

//! ```
//!
//! A session is what every peer-facing consumer looks up: inbound block and
//! service streams are served by it, hydration and repair draw their content
//! sources from it, and the convergence executor that closes a projection
//! obligation sits beside it. Everything such a session sends or receives
//! rides the iroh lanes (`SyncStack::transports_for`), so whether one exists
//! is decided here from exactly two facts:
//!
//! * the peer is authorized: `PeerAuthorityState` pins its signing key, the
//!   same predicate transport admission uses. What it may read or write is
//!   still decided per group on every request; this only decides whether
//!   there is anything to ask.
//! * the substrate can reach it: this device's endpoint holds a live
//!   connection to it. The session lives as long as that connection and is
//!   opened again, with backoff, when a new one can be made.
//!
//! Losing either ends the session. A device the netmap withdraws loses its
//! key (the per-peer keeper is stopped and removes its session) and its
//! connections (closed by `PeerConnectivityRuntime::revoke_device`, which
//! ends the keeper's wait on its own). Dropping the reconciliation driver --
//! how a device stops answering peers -- stops every keeper, and each one
//! removes the session it registered.
//!
//! The legacy QUIC transport decides none of this and exchanges nothing
//! with a session.
