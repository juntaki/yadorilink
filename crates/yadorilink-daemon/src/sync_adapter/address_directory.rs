//! The coordination plane, seen as an address directory.
//!
//! `yadorilink_sync_substrate::AddressDirectory` is deliberately small: publish
//! this endpoint's addresses, resolve another endpoint's. That is the whole of
//! what this device owes iroh, because everything downstream of "where is this
//! endpoint" -- candidate collection, reflexive addresses, relays, NAT
//! traversal, path selection and path migration -- is iroh's already. Adding
//! any of it here would be reimplementing it.
//!
//! What is kept on this side is what iroh cannot know: who a peer is and
//! whether this device is allowed to talk to them. Identity needs no separate
//! binding, because an endpoint id IS the device's signing key and the netmap
//! already pins it.
//!
//! # Why the substrate no longer reads the netmap's candidate list
//!
//! It used to. That list is also the legacy peer-session transport's dial
//! targets: `peer_orchestrator` hands the same `peer.endpoints` to
//! `candidate_endpoints` and to `record_peer_candidate_addresses`. The two
//! transports listen on different sockets with different ALPNs, and a dial
//! that lands on the other one completes at the QUIC layer and is then refused
//! for an unknown ALPN -- a hard failure rather than a path worth retrying.
//! Measured every way round, one list cannot serve both: whichever socket it
//! names, the other transport breaks on it.
//!
//! So the two address spaces are separated at the source. The legacy transport
//! keeps the netmap's candidate list; the substrate gets this directory.
