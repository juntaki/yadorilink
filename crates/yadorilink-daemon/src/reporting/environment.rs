//! Task 3.2/3.3: builds the `ReportEnvironment` every generated report
//! envelope needs (`yadorilink-reporting::builder::ReportEnvironment`),
//! gathered once here from this process's own build/platform constants
//! and the caller-supplied consent state, rather than read directly by
//! `yadorilink-reporting` itself (see that crate's module doc comment for
//! why it stays platform-detection-free).
//!
//! `os_version_bucket` is deliberately `"unknown"`: there is no existing
//! dependency-free way in this workspace to read a coarse OS version
//! string (e.g. "14.x", "24.04") across macOS/Windows/Linux, and adding a
//! new dependency (e.g. `os_info`) for one field is out of scope. This
//! field is documented as "coarse, e.g. ...", not guaranteed-present, so
//! `"unknown"` is a valid, honest coarse bucket rather than a fabricated
//! one. Flagged here for a future follow-up rather than silently guessed
//! at.
