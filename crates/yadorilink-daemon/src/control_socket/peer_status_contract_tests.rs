#![cfg(test)]
//! What a peer's connection state means to a user, read back through the
//! real `Status` and `Health` control-socket requests.
//!
//! Four claims are pinned for every connection state:
//!
//! - how the peer appears in `StatusResponse.peers` (reachability, route,
//!   failure reason), which the CLI and the desktop app render verbatim;
//! - whether it counts in `HealthResponse.connected_peer_count`;
//! - whether it raises a `peer_disconnected` attention reason;
//! - whether a file whose content only that peer holds is available to
//!   fetch now. Durability is asserted alongside and must never move with
//!   connectivity: a fresh custody confirmation stays a fresh confirmation
//!   whether or not its peer can be reached this minute.
//!
//! The connection state is set only through [`observe`], which feeds the
//! iroh connectivity runtime the same reports its endpoint gives it. Changing
//! where reachability comes from means changing `observe` (and the source
//! behind it), not these tests: they state what each state must mean,
//! whoever reports it.
