//! The end of a window run's content writes, committed in batches.
//!
//! A pass settles a run of independent files concurrently. Each file still
//! writes its temp file, syncs it, renames it into place and syncs the
//! parent directory on its own; what it then has left is one small
//! transaction (the proof, `Present`, the intent clear and the obligation's
//! completion). Here the files of one run hand that transaction to a shared
//! queue instead of committing it themselves, and whichever of them is
//! polled when the queue is due commits everybody's in ONE SQLite
//! transaction, each item under its own savepoint and its own checks (see
//! `ReplicaCoordinator::close_content_writes`).
//!
//! The same collector also batches each file's metadata step (the scaffold
//! row and the metadata columns, `Participant::submit_metadata`), which a file
//! takes after its own path lock and before its write: it queues an owned item
//! and waits while still holding the lock and its root operation, one
//! transaction applies the queue with a savepoint and a root check per item.
//! That queue is due when every participant not yet past the step has queued.
//!
//! # Who owns what
//!
//! A file's task awaits its completion's outcome while it still holds
//! everything it held while writing: its path lock, its root operation and
//! permit, its claim. The queue holds only owned data (the item and the
//! reply channel). The path lock matters most: between the rename and this
//! commit the row is `Hydrating` with its intent open, and a scan that
//! captured the path in that gap would author the disk's bytes as a new
//! local version that the later commit would then wrongly prove as the
//! received one. So the lock is released only after the outcome has arrived.
//!
//! A batch is committed on the blocking pool (`YADORILINK_RECEIVE_ASYNC_COMMIT`,
//! on unless `0`): whichever waiter finds the queue due takes the batch and
//! hands it to a job that owns the items, the reply channels and the commit,
//! and every future of the run, that one included, goes on being polled by
//! the one task that owns the run. The job replies to each waiter and wakes
//! them; nothing in it touches a waiter's guards.
//!
//! What keeps the guards alive until the commit is decided is the job fence:
//! when a batch is taken, every item's waiter learns its fence (under the
//! window's lock, so before any later drop can look at it), and a waiter
//! holds a `BatchWait` for as long as it holds its item's guards. Dropped
//! after its batch was taken (the run was cancelled, a sibling panicked), its
//! `Drop` blocks until the job has finished, however the job ends: the fence
//! completes last, also when the job panics or is dropped before it ran. A
//! future dropped while its item is still queued takes its guards with it and
//! closes its reply channel; the next flush discards every item whose channel
//! is closed instead of committing it, so nothing is committed for a file
//! that no longer holds its lock, and the drop and the take cannot interleave
//! because both happen on the run's task. A panic in the commit rolls its
//! transaction back and drops the reply channels, so each waiting file sees an
//! error. In all those cases the file is left as a crash after its
//! parent-directory sync would leave it: bytes on disk, row in flight, intent
//! and obligation open. With the knob off the flush runs in the flushing poll,
//! as before.
//!
//! # When it flushes
//!
//! - when every participant still in the run has queued (nobody else can
//!   arrive soon), which is immediately for a lone file;
//! - when the queue holds as many items as the run's concurrency limit;
//! - when the oldest item has waited `max_latency`.
//!
//! A participant is a run entry that is past its byte-budget wait and has
//! not finished; it leaves the window when its future ends, however it ends,
//! and that wakes the waiters to look again.
