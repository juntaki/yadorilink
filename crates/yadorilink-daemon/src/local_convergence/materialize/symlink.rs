        // hold clears, the row looks like an ordinary, unprotected

        // the symlink and opens its own intent, or (a `PolicySkipped`
        // outcome -- no recorded target, or Windows-without-opt-in) opens

        // `PolicySkipped` exit -- or any transient failure

        // own intent-guard open -- lands the row at `Placeholder`,
        // `held_reason` NULL, no intent, and (this row never carries a
        // projection obligation once hazard settlement deleted it) no
        // obligation either: none of the tombstone loop's three vetoes.

        // the same target (see `MaterializationIntentRepository::begin_
