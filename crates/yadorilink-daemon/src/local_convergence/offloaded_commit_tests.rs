#![cfg(test)]
//! Commits that run on the blocking pool while the file's task keeps
//! polling: what a dropped or panicking waiter may not break.
//!
//! The commit of a file's open and of the collectors' batches runs on another
//! thread. The frames that wait for it keep holding what the commit is about
//! (path lock, the lane's and the row's root operations, claim), and must keep
//! holding it until the commit has landed or rolled back, even when they are
//! dropped mid-commit. The root operations are the observable: a lease that
//! is stopping only drains once every operation admitted on it has dropped.
