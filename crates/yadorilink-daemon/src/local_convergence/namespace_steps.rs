//! The namespace steps of a reconcile pass: what a path has to be once
//! the tree around it is taken into account, and the disk work that gets
//! it there.
//!
//! Replication is per path; a filesystem is a tree. `a` cannot be a file
//! while `a/x` lives, and a directory this device made only to hold `a/x`
//! goes when `a/x` goes. The namespace projection
//! (`yadorilink_replica_engine::namespace`) decides the tree; these steps
//! carry it out for the paths a pass touches and their ancestors:
//!
//! * a path a live descendant needs becomes a directory (structural, or the
//!   explicit Directory its own heads name), and a File or Symlink there
//!   moves beside it under its conflict-copy name -- written there first,
//!   removed from the path only once the copy holds it;
//! * a directory this device created only for descendants is removed with
//!   a single non-recursive `rmdir` once nothing needs it and it is empty;
//! * a file whose name is held by a directory this device may not remove
//!   -- one holding content it does not replicate, or one it did not make
//!   -- stays at its copy name, and the path settles as retained instead of
//!   retrying.
//!
//! None of it is authored. The relocation removes the path's index row
//! rather than tombstoning it, so capture finds neither a file to delete
//! nor a directory it did not know about; every step bumps the path's
//! mutation fence before it touches disk.
