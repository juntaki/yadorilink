//! Per-call timing for one reconcile pass.
//!
//! A [`ReconcileCallTimer`] is created once per `reconcile_group_paths` call
//! and threaded by reference through every function that call touches, so
//! every number it reports is scoped to THIS call, never a sibling's --
//! overlapping calls (e.g. the windowed reprojection backstop running
//! alongside an obligation tick) cannot contaminate each other the way a
//! global before/after counter diff does. Its internals are atomics only
//! because concurrent work WITHIN one call (block fetches, `spawn_blocking`
//! store/SQLite work) can run on different executor threads.
