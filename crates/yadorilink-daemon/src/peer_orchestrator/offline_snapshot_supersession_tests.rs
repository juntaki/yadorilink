//! What the first live netmap of a run does to the last-known-good
//! authorization the daemon started on.
//!
//! The snapshot on disk is this device's memory of what the coordination
//! plane last told it, kept so a restart taken while that plane is
//! unreachable can go on syncing with peers on the same local network. It is
//! never an authority, and the moment a live netmap arrives it stops being
//! the answer: the netmap replaces it whole, which includes withdrawing
//! every peer the netmap no longer names.
//!
//! That last half is what these tests are about. Applying a netmap is
//! otherwise additive per peer -- a peer it names is admitted, pinned and
//! published -- so the only thing that expresses a removal is the diff
//! against the netmap this device was acting on. Starting that diff from an
//! empty map, as a fresh process once did, meant the first netmap of a run
//! could not remove anybody: a restored peer the plane had already deleted
//! kept its pinned key and its groups until some LATER netmap happened to
//! remove it, which for a deleted device never comes.
//!
//! # Level
//!
//! Daemon lib, over a real on-disk index reopened by a second `DaemonState`
//! -- the same shape as this crate's other restart tests, and the smallest
//! level at which "restart" is a real event. The netmap goes in through
//! `apply_netmap_membership`, the function the WebSocket receive loop calls
//! once a frame has been admitted as an authoritative snapshot; what the
//! loop adds on top of it (parsing, generation admission, the per-peer
//! two-phase pass) has its own tests next door.
