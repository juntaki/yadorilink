//! `DurabilityConfirmationJob` -- the periodic sweep that keeps
//! `DaemonState::group_durability_status`'s `Protected` standing on real
//! peer evidence rather than on this device's own opinion of itself.
//!
//! It used to do that by re-running the action-time handoff proof for every
//! linked group: one `VersionPresent(for_handoff = true)` round-trip per
//! durability root, each of which made the peer read that version's blocks
//! back off its own disk and re-hash them. Eight thousand roots meant eight
//! thousand of each, every ninety seconds, to refresh a status indicator.
//!
//! It now runs `background_custody::run_cycle`, which asks each candidate
//! peer one question about the whole group and reads no block on either
//! side. What that answer means -- and, more importantly, what it does not
//! -- is `BackgroundCustodyEvidence`'s own doc comment; the short version is
//! that it is a health signal and never a permission, and that every
//! destructive action still establishes the strong form for itself at the
//! moment it acts.
//!
//! Structurally still mirrors `MaterializationRepairJob` -- same shape (a
//! struct holding its components, a `sweep_interval()` accessor read
//! fresh each sleep, an `async fn run_once`), same reason: the
//! correctness-bearing part lives elsewhere and is independently tested;
//! this job owns only *when* it runs. Unlike that job it does not hold
//! `DaemonState`: it holds exactly what a cycle reads (see
//! `background_custody::CustodyCycleComponents`) plus the coordinator whose
//! link table and file index it walks.
