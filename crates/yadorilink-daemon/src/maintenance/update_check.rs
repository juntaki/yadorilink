//! `UpdateCheckJob` -- one attempt of the periodic background update
//! check. See `maintenance_coordinator.rs`'s own spawn site for the full
//! jitter/backoff/`#[cfg]`-gating context this job's loop participates
//! in: this struct only owns the "one check" logic itself, not the
//! interval/backoff bookkeeping. `consecutive_failures` spans multiple
//! calls to `run_once` (it decides how long to sleep *between* calls),
//! so it stays loop state in the coordinator rather than moving into
//! this job -- narrowing this job down to `Arc<UpdateManager>` alone
//! would not be possible if it also owned that counter.
