//! Track Send daemon integration: a one-shot P2P file send/receive lane,
//! deliberately separate from the sync/materialization machinery every
//! other module in this crate ultimately serves. See `yadorilink-send`'s
//! own crate doc comment for the full design; this module is only the
//! daemon-side glue that:
//!
//! - implements [`yadorilink_send::DeviceDirectory`] against this
//!   daemon's already-known device list (`PeerAuthorityState::peer_signing_key`/
//!   `device_id_for_signing_key`, the iroh substrate reachability the
//!   coordination plane reported, and grant-derived peers -- all
//!   connectivity/identity bookkeeping, never anything DAG- or
//!   materialization-related);
//! - decides who may open a connection on Track Send's own ALPN
//!   ([`track_send_admission`]): a device with a live grant, or the
//!   receiver of an offer this device's user sent and it accepted. Folder
//!   group membership is never a reason, in either direction;
//! - waits for the reconciliation stack's iroh endpoint to exist, then
//!   builds and publishes this device's one `yadorilink_send::SendService`
//!   over it;
//! - runs its inbound-connection dispatcher for as long as that endpoint;
//! - exposes the two thin control-socket-facing wrappers
//!   ([`SendTransferService`] for `send`/`receive`,
//!   [`InboxQueries`] for `inbox`) that `adapters::build_application_
//!   services`/`build_query_services` wire in like any other narrow
//!   port -- `control_context.rs`'s own doc comment is explicit that
//!   `ControlContext` itself must never gain a raw `DaemonState` field,
//!   so this module deliberately does not ask for one.

/// Exactly two reasons, both about Track Send itself:
///
/// - a live grant names the device (`DaemonState::send_grant_peers`, TTL
///   pruned on every read): the sender this device was told to expect, or
///   the receiver this device's own grant request named;
/// - this device sent it an offer that it accepted, so it may come back to
///   pull the content after the grant has expired -- but only while the
///   device is still one this device's netmap pins. An accepted offer is a
///   durable record that never expires; on its own it would keep admitting
///   a device for the life of the send database, including after that
///   device was removed from the account. Past the grant, the device's
///   current authority is what admits it, exactly as for any other
///   connection from it.
///
/// Being a pinned sync peer is not on its own a reason, and admission here
/// is not a reason to be a sync peer: the sync ALPN has its own admission.
/// Pinned means the netmap lists the device with its key, which is identity,
/// not folder-group membership. An admitted connection still cannot deliver
/// an offer without presenting a grant the coordination plane consumes
/// (`SendService::handle_offer`).
///
/// Read live on every connection, so an expired grant or a withdrawn device
/// stops admitting on the next one; `PeerConnectivityRuntime::revoke_device`
/// asks it again to close the Track Send connections a withdrawn device
/// already has. Weak, so the policy does not keep the daemon state alive.
