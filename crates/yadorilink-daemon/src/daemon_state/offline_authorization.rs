//! This device's last-known-good authorization snapshot: the on-disk
//! mirror of what a live netmap last told it about its peers, and the
//! provenance marker that says which of the two a running daemon is
//! currently acting on.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! Two devices on the same local network are not broken merely because the
//! coordination plane, the relays or the internet are. The authorization
//! that let them sync was verified against that plane while it WAS
//! reachable; this keeps that last verified answer on disk so a restart
//! taken while the plane is unreachable can rediscover the same peers over
//! the local network and go on syncing.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! An authority. Nothing here decides anything. Every row is written by a
//! live netmap application mirroring a decision the plane already made and
//! this device already verified, is replaced wholesale by the next such
//! application, and is deleted when a netmap withdraws the peer. So:
//!
//! - a live netmap always wins -- it overwrites this on the way past;
//! - a peer absent from the snapshot is never authorized while offline,
//!   because offline operation continues an authorization and never starts
//!   one;
//! - a local-network announcement is not authority either: it is matched
//!   against the pinned signing key in the snapshot, and a different key
//!   matches nothing (fail closed);
//! - a revoke withdraws the peer from memory and from disk together, so
//!   restarting does not resurrect it.
//!
//! Detecting a revocation that happens at the plane WHILE this device is
//! offline is explicitly out of scope, and nothing here claims it. The
//! contract is exactly "keep using the last verified authorization while
//! offline", nothing more.
//!
//! # What "never widens" means on the READ path
//!
//! The write path only ever mirrors a live netmap, so nothing written here
//! can be wider than what the plane granted. That says nothing about a row
//! that arrived some other way, so state it plainly: the index database is
//! trusted local state, on the same footing as this device's own signing
//! key and credential store, which sit in the same directory under the same
//! OS user. Anyone who can write it can already forge this device's own
//! change history, so these tables are not a new trust boundary -- but they
//! are not defended by one either, and a reader should not imagine
//! otherwise.
//!
//! Two things keep that from being a blank cheque:
//!
//! - what these rows can confer is bounded. They pin a peer's key and say
//!   which groups it was authorized for; they do not decide what may be
//!   WRITTEN. Change admission takes that from the group's signed policy
//!   chain, which is verified record by record against the pinned
//!   coordination service key (a file outside this database) and against
//!   the persisted rollback watermark -- see
//!   `peer_orchestrator::restore_offline_group_policy_states`. A row
//!   naming a device no policy chain grants buys a dial, not a write.
//! - an authorization is acted on offline only while it is RECENT. See
//!   [`OFFLINE_AUTHORIZATION_HORIZON_SECS`]: past it, a peer is authorized
//!   again only by a live netmap.

    /// `effective_servable_groups` intersects the netmap's groups with
    /// what this device's own policy verification currently admits, so a
    /// group that went policy-stale drops out of the settled set while
    /// the netmap still names it. Crash in the window and the row on disk
    /// still lists that group, and the next offline start restores it.
    ///
    /// Severity, and why this is accepted rather than closed: the stale
    /// group's own fail-closed gate is not this row. A restored group
    /// admits no change until its stored policy chain re-verifies against
    /// the pinned coordination service key and the rollback watermark
    /// (`peer_orchestrator::restore_offline_group_policy_states`), and a
    /// group that went stale is precisely one whose chain does not
    /// verify. So the widened row buys a dial and a pinned key for a peer
    /// the plane does name, and no write admission. Closing it costs a
    /// second durable transaction per peer per push -- the write
    /// amplification `SNAPSHOT_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS` and this variant
    /// exist to remove -- to narrow a window of a few lines that is
    /// already gated elsewhere, so the window is accepted rather than
    /// closed.
