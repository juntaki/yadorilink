//! `SyncError`, relocated from `yadorilink-sync-core::error` (Phase 7D-10
//! Tier 2). `yadorilink-daemon`'s own `ReplicaCoordinator` is the composition
//! root that legitimately composes every subsystem this enum's variants
//! wrap (`yadorilink-sync-sqlite`, `yadorilink-replica-engine`,
//! `yadorilink-filesystem-sync`, `yadorilink-root-authority`,
//! `yadorilink-transport`, ...) and needs one error type to `?`-propagate
//! from whichever subsystem failed at its own call sites -- the same
//! composition-root shape that already justified hosting `ReplicaCoordinator`
//! and `dag_import.rs` here (see `docs/design/phase7d10-elimination-plan.md`
//! §2.3). Nearly every variant already has a narrower, subsystem-owned
//! equivalent (`SyncSqliteError`, `RootAuthorityError`,
//! `MaterializationExecutionError`, ...); this type is the union those
//! narrower types feed into at the one place that legitimately needs the
//! union.
//!
//! `yadorilink-sync-core::error::SyncError` was a byte-identical sibling of
//! this type during the transitional coexistence period, when `SyncState`
//! was still live production surface and two `yadorilink-local-capture`-owned
//! port traits (`LocalMutationStore`, `MaterializationStatePort`) were pinned
//! to it in their own method signatures. Both traits' associated error types
//! were since narrowed off the wide `SyncError` union onto their own
//! subsystem-owned types (`SyncSqliteError`/`MaterializationExecutionError`),
//! and `yadorilink-sync-core` itself was deleted in Phase 7D-10's final
//! elimination pass -- this crate has no remaining coexistence boundary with
//! it. Every production call site in this crate (and `yadorilink-cli`/
//! `yadorilink-desktop-app`, which had none) uses this type.
