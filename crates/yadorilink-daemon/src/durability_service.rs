//! precedence [`classify`] applies to derive a group's status from the
//! facts `DaemonState` gathers, and the injectable custody confirmer the
//! on-demand eviction path uses to verify a specific version's blocks are
//! durably held elsewhere before reclaiming them locally.
//!
//! `group_durability_latch`/`custody_confirmer` are private, reached only
//! through this type's own methods. `classify` itself is a free function
//! taking plain facts, not a method, so it can be table-driven-tested in

//! # Canonical durability model
//!
//! `GroupDurabilityStatus` is this daemon's one authoritative "is this
//! group's data protected" derivation — every other surface (IPC/wire
//! DTOs, CLI, desktop app) must project from it rather than reconstructing
//! an equivalent judgment from lower-level booleans. Core invariant:
//! **Durability != Connectivity.** This module never reads
//! `PeerReachability`, relay route state, or any other connectivity
//! signal, and must never be changed to. A group being `Protected` says
//! nothing about whether it can be fetched *right now*; a peer being
//! online/reachable says nothing about whether this group is `Protected`.
//! See [`crate::route`]'s own doc comment for the parallel invariant on the
//! connectivity side.
//!
//! `Protected` requires real peer-confirmed evidence
//! (`DaemonState::full_replica_handoff_ready`, an exact-version-hash,
//! generation-stability-checked round-trip -- this is ALSO how a
//! genuinely-empty group reaches `Protected`, since that function's own real
//! durability-root enumeration confirms a vacuous root set exactly like a
//! non-empty one; there is deliberately no separate "does this device's
//! local file count look like zero" shortcut, since that would miss
//! retained/trash-restorable durability roots). The evidence is cached
//! with a staleness bound (monotonic clock) AND a membership-generation
//! binding by `DurabilityConfirmationJob`'s periodic sweep -- either aging
//! out or any peer netmap change since the confirmation invalidates it.
//! This device's own local materialization completeness is never
//! sufficient on its own: a device with a fully materialized local copy
//! and zero peer confirmation must never report `Protected`, since no peer
//! may hold the group at all.
