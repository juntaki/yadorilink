//! Narrow, per-link dependency bundle threaded through this module tree

//! only what the per-link watch/capture/repair machinery actually uses,
//! not every other subsystem (peer sessions, governance config, update
//! management, ...) that lives alongside it at the daemon-wide level.
//!
//! Constructed once per relevant call from the daemon-wide state (see that
//! type's own `link_runtime_dependencies` constructor) and threaded down
//! into [`super::LinkRuntime`]'s construction, its per-link operations, and
//! every one of the per-link background tasks the daemon's own `LinkRuntimeController` spawns.
