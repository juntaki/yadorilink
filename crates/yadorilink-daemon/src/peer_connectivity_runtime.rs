//! Two lifetimes, one owner. What a peer's reachability is, and what this
//! device publishes about itself, outlives any one endpoint: the netmap is
//! usually applied before an endpoint exists, and what it recorded has to be
//! replayed into the endpoint's directory the moment there is one. The
//! endpoint itself lives exactly as long as the reconciliation stack that
//! drives it, because dropping that stack is how a device stops answering
//! peers; a process-lifetime handle to it would keep a "stopped" device
//! reachable.
//!
//! Nothing here decides who a peer is or what it may do. Admission and
//! identity resolution read `PeerAuthorityState`; an address, from the plane
//! or from anywhere else, only says where an already-authorized endpoint
//! answers.
//!
//! Whole-device revocation ends here too ([`PeerConnectivityRuntime::revoke_device`]):
//! admission is checked once, when a connection is accepted, so withdrawing a
//! key refuses the NEXT connection and says nothing to the ones already up.
//! This runtime is the one place that knows every connection each endpoint
//! holds -- sync links and Track Send connections alike -- so it is the one
//! place that closes them.
//!
//! What `yadorilink status`, the health count and "available now" say about a
//! peer comes from here too ([`PeerConnectivityRuntime::reachability`]), and
//! only from the iroh endpoint's own reports -- see `reachability`. The
//! legacy QUIC transport keeps its own state in
//! `daemon_state::PeerConnectivityState` until it is removed, and no longer
//! decides what a peer's reachability is.
