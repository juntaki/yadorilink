//! Connects the daemon to the coordination plane's netmap stream and
//! applies what it says: which peers this device is authorized to reach,
//! which groups it shares with each of them, and which group policies are
//! in force. Peer sessions themselves are not this module's -- one exists
//! because a peer is authorized and the iroh substrate reaches it
//! (`peer_connectivity_runtime::keep_peer_sessions`).
//!
//! The coordination netmap subscription
//! (channel connect, RPC, stream) used to be one-shot: any failure,
//! including one on the very first attempt before the network was up,
//! permanently ended `run` and left the daemon with no P2P sync until a
//! human restarted it.
//! `run` now retries that whole setup forever with backoff (every failure
//! — initial or later — is just another attempt); `run` itself stays up
//! for the daemon's whole lifetime (see its doc comment).
//!
//! That retry loop deliberately runs *inline* in `run`'s own task rather
//! than via `supervise::spawn_restarting`: `spawn_restarting` retries
//! inside a second, independently `tokio::spawn`ed task, so externally
//! aborting the task *running* `run` (as `main.rs`'s graceful
//! shutdown does, via `JoinSet::shutdown`) would only cancel `run`'s
//! `.await` on that task's `JoinHandle` — the detached retry loop
//! underneath would keep running past the abort (confirmed against
//! `supervise::tests::spawn_restarting_stops_when_aborted_from_outside`,
//! which only asserts no *new* attempt starts after abort, not that an
//! *in-flight* one stops). Keeping the loop inline means an external
//! abort of `run`'s task cancels it mid-connect or mid-sleep with nothing
//! left running behind it — see `reconnect_delay`'s doc comment for the
//! resulting small duplication of `BackoffConfig`'s jitter math.
