//! Unary coordination-plane calls the daemon makes outside the netmap
//! subscription: this device's substrate address report, and the
//! activate/cancel calls
//! `EnrollmentRecoveryService::reconcile_once` issues for a create/join left
//! over from a previous run. Each speaks the coordination plane over its
//! HTTP+JSON API, the same host the netmap WebSocket subscription connects to.
//!
//! Every call is best-effort: a failure is logged at debug and swallowed, so
//! a transient coordination-plane outage never takes down the caller's task.
//! The activate calls below return an
//! [`ActivateOutcome`] (rather than swallowing the result entirely) so
//! `EnrollmentRecoveryService::reconcile_once` knows whether it is safe to drop its
//! local marker, must mark the link orphaned, or should leave the marker for
//! the next sweep to retry. The cancel calls stay a bare success/failure
//! bool: `reconcile` treats a cancel as best-effort regardless of why it
//! failed (the coordination plane's own TTL sweep is the eventual backstop
//! either way), so there is no extra outcome for it to branch on.
//!
//! # Every call here takes a credential, not a token
//!
//! These functions used to take `access_token: &str` and call `bearer_auth`.
//! They now take a [`CoordinationAuth`], and the difference is not cosmetic:
//! the Coordination API is a DPoP resource server, so an authenticated request
//! needs a live access token **and** a proof signed by that token's key and
//! bound to this exact method and URL. A `&str` cannot produce the second, and
//! a token captured at daemon startup cannot produce the first either -- it
//! lives five minutes.
//!
//! The whole of that is behind [`SendAuthorized::send_authorized`], which is
//! the only place in this module that touches an `Authorization` header. It
//! reads the method and URL **off the built request** rather than from its
//! caller, so a proof can never be minted for a different call than the one
//! that is sent -- a DPoP proof whose `htm`/`htu` name the wrong endpoint is
//! refused by the server with a 401 that reads exactly like an expired token,
//! and the two are worth being structurally unable to confuse.
