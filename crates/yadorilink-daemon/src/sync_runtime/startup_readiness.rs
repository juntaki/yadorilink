//! Per-group startup-readiness barrier.
//!
//! A group whose filesystem watcher was just (re)started has NOT yet
//! finished reconciling its on-disk state against the index — the startup
//! disk scan reads an old whole-index snapshot and batch-commits records
//! derived from it *without* holding each path's `path_lock`. An incoming
//! peer change applied for the same path in that window (which DOES take
//! `path_lock`) would then be silently clobbered when the scan commits its
//! stale-snapshot record, turning what should be a concurrent conflict into
//! a last-writer overwrite. This gate lets peer-apply (and any other
//! post-startup mutator) wait until the group's startup reconciliation has
//! published its results before touching that group's paths. It is
//! per-group: a slow startup for one group never blocks peer apply for an
//! unrelated, already-ready group.
//!
//! The gate is a small generational 3-state machine rather than a plain
//! ready flag. Each startup attempt for a group gets a monotonic
//! [`StartupGeneration`]; the gate tracks the *latest* generation and its
//! phase (`Starting` / `Ready` / `Failed`). Two properties fall out of this:
//!   - A startup that does NOT complete (panic, task abort, error)
//!     transitions the gate to `Failed`, so peer apply fails *closed*
//!     (deferred) instead of being admitted over the half-built index — a
//!     startup crash can no longer silently open the gate and let peer
//!     changes overwrite un-indexed or un-redriven local state.
//!   - A completion is honored only when it carries the group's *current*
//!     generation, so a stale straggler (an aborted/unlinked old executor,
//!     or an earlier overlapping startup) can neither open nor fail a newer
//!     startup's barrier.
//!
//! This registry owns only the in-memory gate map and its notify-based
//! wait/wake logic. Deciding what an *absent* gate means for a given group
//! (no link on this device at all, vs. a live link whose startup never got
//! off the ground) requires reading the link table, which is SQL-backed and
//! stays on the caller (`SyncState::wait_group_ready`) rather than being
//! pulled into this in-memory-only registry.
