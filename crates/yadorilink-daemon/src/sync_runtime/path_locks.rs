/// paths on filesystems actually proven case/normalization-insensitive.
/// Delegates to `hazard::canonical_fold` rather than reimplementing an
/// equivalent-looking fold locally (an earlier version of this function
/// computed `nfc(p).to_lowercase()` directly): this must stay the SAME
/// function the hazard checks use, not merely one that happens to agree
/// with them on the cases tried so far, or a future divergence between the
/// two could silently reopen the exact race this key exists to close. In
/// particular, `canonical_fold` is also what
/// `hazard::case_and_normalization_collision` uses, so the lock this
/// function computes and the combined-axis hazard check it must be atomic
/// with can never drift apart from each other by construction.

/// on the per-connection message-handling task the first time this
/// was tried with a blocking mutex here. The registry map itself
/// (this outer `Mutex`) stays `std::sync::Mutex`: it's only ever held
/// briefly to look up/insert an entry, never across an await.
