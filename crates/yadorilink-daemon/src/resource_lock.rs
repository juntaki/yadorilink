//! Process-lifetime exclusive locks on the daemon's *mutable data resources* —
//! the block-store root and the sync-state SQLite database.
//!
//! The config-directory lock ([`crate::app`]'s `DaemonInstanceLock`) only
//! guarantees a single daemon per *config directory*. But the block-store root
//! and the SQLite database path are independently overridable
//! (`YADORILINK_BLOCK_STORE` / `YADORILINK_SYNC_DB`), so two daemons started
//! with *distinct* config directories — each holding its own config-dir lock —
//! could still be pointed at the *same* store root and/or database. Two writers
//! over one block store or one SQLite index risks index/store corruption:
//! `SegmentBlockStore`'s internal locks are process-local and SQLite's WAL mode
//! happily lets both processes open the same file. These locks close that gap,
//! additively (the config-dir lock is untouched).
//!
//! Mechanism: an OS advisory exclusive lock (`flock`/`LockFileEx` via `fs2`),
//! applied in two layers together. First, a *sidecar* lock file whose location
//! is derived from the **canonicalized** resource path (both resources, all
//! platforms). Second (Linux/Android only, sync DB only), an additional
//! whole-file flock on the **live database inode itself**, to catch same-inode
//! aliases whose canonical path — and therefore sidecar path — differs (see
//! below). Like the config-dir lock, the OS releases the locks on process exit
//! (including SIGKILL/crash) and the lock files are left in place — acquisition
//! never parses PIDs or deletes "stale" files.
//!
//! ## What is caught
//!
//! By canonicalize + sidecar (all platforms):
//!
//! * the exact same path;
//! * `..`-relative aliases;
//! * symlinked parent directories;
//! * a symlink pointing directly at an *existing* database file (its full path
//!   canonicalizes to the real file);
//! * a **directory** bind mount of a parent: the sidecar is one real inode
//!   inside the shared directory, so both mount paths open it and conflict even
//!   though their canonical paths differ (handle identity).
//!
//! Additionally, by the live-inode flock (Linux/Android, sync DB only):
//!
//! * a **file** bind mount of the database file itself (same inode, different
//!   canonical path — hence a different sidecar);
//! * a **hard link** of the database file into another path/directory.
//!
//! ## What is NOT caught (known limitations)
//!
//! * On **macOS, the BSDs, and Windows**, the file-bind-mount and
//!   hard-link-of-DB-file cases are NOT caught — there is no live-inode flock
//!   there. This is deliberate, not an oversight: verification showed that on
//!   macOS a whole-file `flock` held on the SQLite file makes SQLite itself
//!   return `database is locked`, and on Windows `fs2`'s whole-file
//!   `LockFileEx` range overlaps the byte range SQLite locks — so locking the
//!   live DB inode is unsafe on those platforms. They get sidecar-only. (The
//!   block-store root has no equivalent gap on any platform: a directory cannot
//!   be hard-linked, and a directory bind mount is already caught by the
//!   sidecar's inode identity.)
//! * **NFS**, even on Linux: `flock` there is emulated via whole-file POSIX
//!   byte-range locks that can interact with SQLite's own POSIX locks, and
//!   SQLite is itself officially unsupported on NFS. Running the daemon's
//!   database on NFS is out of scope.
//! * **Concurrent-rename TOCTOU**: the lock is taken on the canonical path
//!   resolved at acquisition time; `SyncState`/`SegmentBlockStore` then open the
//!   originally-configured path. A hostile concurrent rename or symlink swap
//!   between those two steps could make them diverge. Out of threat model —
//!   this guards a cooperative env-override *misconfiguration*, not an attacker
//!   racing the filesystem.
//! * **Dangling symlink to a not-yet-created target**: when neither daemon's
//!   database exists yet, canonicalization falls back to canonical-parent +
//!   filename, so two daemons pointing distinct dangling symlinks at the same
//!   eventual target may both start until the file is created. Also out of
//!   threat model.
