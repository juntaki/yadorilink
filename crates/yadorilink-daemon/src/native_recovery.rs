//! Native recovery in the live daemon: sealing this device's state for a peer
//! that holds none, and verifying and installing a state a peer sealed.
//!
//! A peer that holds no native state of the group (a new device, a new member,
//! a replica with a lost database) asks for recovery. The serving device seals
//! its current native state, asks the group's authority to authorize that exact
//! checkpoint (the authority applies its own live writer check: authorized
//! writers are trusted for the completeness of what they seal), and sends the authorized bundle. The receiving device verifies the
//! authorization against its own view of the group's policy chain, re-derives
//! every head from its signed delta, recomputes the signed roots and only then
//! installs the bundle (see `yadorilink_sync_sqlite::native_bootstrap`). A
//! device that already holds state of the group replaces it only through a
//! rebootstrap (see `crate::native_rebootstrap`); a device that holds none installs
//! the bundle as a first join (see `install_checkpoint`).
