//! Resolves an absolute filesystem path to its `(group_id, relative_path)`
//! pair -- a thin `Arc<SyncState>`-holding wrapper around `shell_status`'s
//! resolver, in the same shape as the other query services so callers go
//! through `context.queries.linked_path` rather than reaching for the free
//! function directly. Shared by `FileHistoryQueryService`'s read paths and
//! (later) the materialization/restore command services, which all resolve
//! the same absolute-path-to-group mapping before doing their own thing
//! with it.
