//! An *independent reference model* for the two-device chaos scenario's
//! converged end state.
//!
//! Why this exists (the gap it closes): `oracle.rs`'s `GlobalOracle` is an
//! *invariant checker* — it observes the real run and asserts predicates
//! (convergence, no-loss, no-corruption, conflict-copy accounting,
//! structural). Every one of those predicates is structurally blind to a
//! *consistent-but-wrong converged winner*: if every device agrees on a
//! value that some device genuinely wrote, but which is NOT the value the
//! conflict rules say should win, `check_convergence` (all devices agree),
//! `check_no_loss` (both racing writes survive somewhere), and
//! `check_no_corruption` (every byte on disk was written by someone) all
//! pass. Nothing re-derives, from the input timeline alone, *which* content
//! should be the live/canonical winner and *which* should be a conflict
//! copy.
//!
//! This module is that missing reference model. It takes the *input*
//! timeline (per-device ordered ops, with their input mtimes and causal
//! round) — never the version vectors the implementation produced — and
//! predicts, per path, the expected converged state: the winning content
//! id at the canonical path plus the multiset of conflict-copy contents.
//! `check_reference_model` then compares that prediction to the real
//! converged on-disk snapshot.
//!
//! ## Independence
//!
//! The winner rule here is re-derived from `conflict.rs`'s *specification*,
//! not by calling `resolve_and_apply_conflict`/`a_is_loser`/
//! `resolve_conflict_names` (which would defeat the point — a bug in the
//! production rule would be copied verbatim into its own oracle). The spec,
//! restated:
//!
//! - A genuine concurrent conflict on a path is resolved by *last-writer-
//!   wins on clamped mtime*: the copy with the later effective mtime wins
//!   the canonical name; the older one is demoted. Effective mtime clamps a
//!   claimed value to at most `now + MAX_FUTURE_MTIME_SKEW_NANOS` before
//!   comparison.
//! - Ties (equal effective mtime) break on device id: the *larger* device
//!   id wins the canonical name (`a_is_loser` returns true — i.e. `a` is the
//!   loser — when `eff_a == eff_b && device_a < device_b`).
//! - Between two concurrent *writes*, that LWW decision picks the winner
//!   directly and *deterministically*: the later-mtime write keeps the
//!   canonical name, the older is preserved under a `(conflicted copy...)`
//!   name. The chaos driver always stamps the second racer's mtime strictly
//!   later, so the winner is a fixed function of the input timeline — this
//!   is the case the model checks.
//! - A concurrent *write-vs-delete* race has **two legitimate converged
//!   outcomes** and is therefore NOT deterministically predictable from the
//!   input timeline alone. Verified against the live scenario across seeds
//!   with the identical race construction (a pending write vs a
//!   concurrently-dispatched delete):
//!     * sometimes the delete is adopted first (as a causally-later
//!       tombstone over the shared base) and then superseded by the
//!       still-pending write resurfacing → the *write wins* the canonical
//!       path, delete dropped, no conflict copy (e.g. seed 3298840596,
//!       chaos-c.bin);
//!     * sometimes the two genuinely reach `resolve_and_apply_conflict` as
//!       `Concurrent` and mtime-LWW makes the later-mtime *delete win* the
//!       canonical path, with the losing write preserved as a conflict copy
//!       (e.g. seed 800000, chaos-a.bin).
//!   Both are consistent, converged, and *data-preserving* (the write's
//!   content survives either as the live file or as a conflict copy), so
//!   neither is "the wrong winner" — the choice depends on simulated
//!   scheduling, not on anything the input timeline determines. The model
//!   therefore **abstains** on any path whose timeline contains a concurrent
//!   write-vs-delete race: it makes no live/conflict-copy prediction for
//!   that path at all. Data-preservation for those paths is still covered by
//!   the existing no-loss / convergence / conflict-copy-accounting oracles;
//!   only the *specific-winner* assertion is skipped, since there is no
//!   single correct winner to assert.
//!
//! ## Conflict-copy identity normalization
//!
//! A conflict copy's real filename embeds a timestamp, device id, and an
//! 8-hex content-hash fragment, none of which this model can (or should)
//! predict. Prediction and checking therefore compare conflict copies by
//! *content* only (is-conflict-copy + which bytes), exactly as the task
//! requires — a conflict copy is identified by "a `(conflicted copy...)`
//! sibling of this path holding these bytes", nothing finer.
//!
//! ## Causality reconstruction (no VVs)
//!
//! P0's two-device chaos driver advances a monotonic per-run round counter;
//! each round touches one path either *solo* (one op) or as a *race* (two
//! concurrent ops on the same path in the same round). Two ops sharing a
//! `(path, round)` are exactly the driver's genuine-concurrent race pair;
//! anything else is causally ordered by round. That is the entire causal
//! signal this model needs, and it is derived from op *structure*, never
//! from the implementation's observed version vectors.
