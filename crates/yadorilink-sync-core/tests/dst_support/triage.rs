//! Automatic
//! artifact-vs-product triage of violations by relaxed-harness replay.
//!
//! Triage today is manual: a violation reaching a human starts from a blank
//! page. makes the harness re-run the same `Case` (same seed, same IR)
//! under a *relaxed* profile -- self-healing sweeps forced at every step,
//! settle budget multiplied, event coalescing off -- and classify: if the
//! violation disappears under relaxation it is `LikelyHarnessArtifact`,
//! with the specific relaxation knob that eliminated it named by bisection;
//! if it persists it is `LikelyProductBug`. The cost model changes from
//! "every failure gets a human" to "humans start from a verdict and a named
//! knob".
//!
//! Deliberately labeled *Likely*: relaxation can mask a real bug that only
//! manifests under tight timing, so `LikelyHarnessArtifact` findings are
//! still surfaced (grouped, non-blocking) rather than dropped, and a corpus
//! entry that later reproduces under an improved harness escalates to
//! `LikelyProductBug`.
//!
//! This module owns the *generic* triage machinery: the profile knob set,
//! the verdict types, and the replay/bisection runner. Replaying a `Case`
//! is inherently scenario-specific (each scenario interprets its `Case`
//! differently), so the runner takes a scenario-provided `replay` closure
//! -- the same seam `DST full-stack heat-run framework`'s supervisor reuses.
//!
//! `#![cfg(madsim)]`-gated like every DST scenario file.
