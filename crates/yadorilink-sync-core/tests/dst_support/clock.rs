//! The one harness-level clock/mtime seam.
//!
//! Before this module every `dst_*.rs` scenario carried its own copy of a
//! seed-derived synthetic "now" plus a `stamp_deterministic_mtime` helper
//! (canonically `dst_network_fault_chaos.rs`'s `virtual_now_nanos` loop and
//! `stamp_deterministic_mtime`), keeping madsim's virtual clock and the
//! kernel-stamped tempdir mtimes on one timeline *by convention*. A write
//! path that forgot to stamp produced a tie-break outcome production could
//! never see -- the single largest DST harness-artifact source.
//! `HarnessClock` owns that logic once, and the `dst_support`
//! file-operation wrappers (see `mod.rs`) stamp through it on every
//! mutation, so "forgot to stamp" becomes unrepresentable rather than a
//! reviewable convention.
//!
//! Seed-derived (not a fixed epoch) is deliberate and was already litigated
//! in the canonical inline comment: a fixed epoch risks a particular seed
//! permanently landing on a tie-break outcome that happens to hide a real
//! bug. Different seeds must explore different regions of the tie-break/
//! clamp space.
//!
//! `#![cfg(madsim)]`-gated like every DST scenario file.
