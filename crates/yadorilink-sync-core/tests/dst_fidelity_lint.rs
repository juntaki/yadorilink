//! The fidelity-lint
//! backstop.
//!
//! Each `dst_*.rs` scenario migrates independently to the shared
//! `dst_support` helpers (small, reviewable diffs). Once a file is
//! migrated, it must not regress to a per-scenario fork of the very thing
//! the migration removed -- a local `stamp_deterministic_mtime`, a fixed
//! settle sleep, or an `outbound_partitioned` boolean. This lint greps the
//! *migrated* files (only) for those banned patterns and fails if any
//! reappears, mirroring the existing inline `PF`-tag discipline: a blunt
//! textual check that only guards files whose migration flag is set and
//! only bans a pattern that has a designated shared replacement.
//!
//! A false positive is a one-line allowlist: put
//! `// fidelity-lint: allow <pattern>` on the same line, with a
//! justification, exactly as the `PF` tags justify their own exceptions.
//!
//! Not `#![cfg(madsim)]`-gated: it reads source text off disk, so it runs
//! in the ordinary `cargo test` legs (and harmlessly under the madsim
//! sweep too).
