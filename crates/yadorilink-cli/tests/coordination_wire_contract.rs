//! Round-trips this workspace's real client code against a real, locally
//! running deployment -- the Authorization Server and the Coordination API,
//! served from one origin by the same composition root staging runs.
//!
//! # What this closes that nothing else can
//!
//! Every other test of these code paths asserts against something a human
//! wrote: either the Rust request struct is built and inspected directly (never
//! becoming JSON at all), or it is sent to a mock HTTP server whose canned
//! response is itself a hand-written guess at what the service sends. Both
//! sides of that arrangement can drift together without any test going red -- a
//! request struct that serializes `refresh_token` where the service reads
//! `refreshToken` still passes a mock that was written to expect
//! `refresh_token`, and the service keeps answering `204` either way.
//!
//! The case worth being precise about is co-drift, not a lone edit. Changing a
//! request struct by itself usually does trip whichever mock-based test pins
//! the old key -- and then the author updates that test to agree with the
//! struct, because it looks like the test is the thing that is out of date. Two
//! hand-written descriptions of the same JSON now agree with each other and
//! disagree with the service, every existing gate is green again, and only a
//! real round trip can still tell.
//!
//! # There is no shortcut in here
//!
//! The credential every request below carries was obtained the way a fresh
//! installation obtains one, in this order and with no step skipped:
//!
//! ```text
//!   generate an ES256 key
//!     -> POST /bootstrap/start                        (no credential at all)
//!     -> a human approves in a browser
//!     -> the browser authenticates at the upstream
//!     -> RFC 7591 registration, for the key that opened the transaction
//!     -> POST /bootstrap/poll                         -> client_id
//!     -> PAR -> authorize -> interaction -> upstream -> code
//!     -> POST /token, private_key_jwt + DPoP          -> access + refresh
//!     -> CoordinationAuth
//! ```
//!
//! That matters beyond tidiness. The previous version of this file signed in
//! through `POST /auth/google/device/*` and presented the resulting `sessions`
//! row as `Authorization: Bearer`, which is a plane that no longer exists on
//! either side of the wire. A harness that kept it would be the reason the
//! legacy plane could not be deleted.
//!
//! The only thing the harness stands in for is Google, which a local run
//! genuinely cannot reach; the seam is outbound-only and lives in
//! `coordination-worker/test/contract/dev-entry.ts`, which is never bundled
//! into a deploy. The harness plays the USER AGENT for the two browser legs --
//! a cookie jar and a redirect chain -- and every byte it sends is one a
//! browser would send.
//!
//! # Inert without a service
//!
//! Every test returns immediately unless `YADORILINK_WIRE_CONTRACT_ADDR` names
//! a running deployment, so an ordinary `cargo test` run compiles them and
//! skips them. Each one announces itself with [`RAN_MARKER`] the moment it has
//! an address and before it does any work, which is what makes a skipped run
//! distinguishable from a real one -- libtest's own summary is not (see that
//! constant).
