//! This crate's binding to the one credential store.
//!
//! There used to be two implementations of the same contract -- this crate's
//! `token_store.rs` and `yadorilink-daemon`'s -- each opening its own
//! `keyring::Entry` under its own idea of the key names, with the CLI writing
//! an access token and the daemon reading it. They have been replaced by
//! [`yadorilink_fapi_client::store`], which holds what is actually durable
//! (the `client_id`, the client private key and the refresh token), refuses a
//! store it cannot fully understand, and takes a cross-process lock before
//! rotating anything.
//!
//! What is left here is the binding, and it is one function: where this
//! process's config directory is. The daemon's equivalent module is the same
//! function over its own `config_dir`, which is deliberately the only thing
//! the two have left in common.
//!
//! # There is one credential shape, and no second place to look
//!
//! This module used to expose `legacy_access_token`, `legacy_refresh_token`
//! and `save_legacy_session` for the pre-cutover coordination plane -- an
//! access token and a refresh token minted by `/auth/google/*` and validated
//! against the `sessions` table. They are gone, with that plane. An
//! installation holds [`Credentials`] or it holds nothing, and "nothing" means
//! not enrolled rather than "try the older store".
