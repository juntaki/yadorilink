//! The client application layer shared by every YadoriLink front end.
//!
//! The command-line tool and the desktop app both reach the local daemon
//! through [`daemon::control`] and the coordination plane through
//! [`coordination`], and drive the same typed operations. Nothing in this
//! crate prints, prompts or exits: every operation returns a typed result or
//! a [`CoreError`], and each front end decides how to present it.
//!
//! Two layers:
//! - [`ops`]: typed, lossless operations over the daemon's control protocol
//!   and the coordination plane, for the command-line tool and the desktop
//!   app.
//! - [`ClientCore`]: the product facade a desktop front end binds to. It
//!   speaks only product types ([`dto`]) and the seven-case [`DesktopError`],
//!   and holds the long-lived handles in [`session`].

// The foreign-language binding for the product types (`dto`, `DesktopError`),
// only when a binding crate asks for it.
