//! Folder groups, their members, invites and approvals: the coordination

//!
//! Same-account `revoke`/`join` are roleless: every authorized device is a
//! full bidirectional peer there. `grant` (also same-account) is role-aware
//! and the coordination plane defaults an omitted role to `editor`.
//! Cross-account sharing (`invite`/`accept`) is role-aware too, with a
//! DIFFERENT omitted-role default (`viewer`, least privilege for a
//! stranger-facing invite). `owner` is available through neither: there is no
//! management-authority model yet to back it.
//!
//! Every membership mutation goes through a daemon command rather than
//! straight to the coordination plane, so the daemon's durability readiness
//! gate and crash-safe enrollment protocol apply to every front end alike.
