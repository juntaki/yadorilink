//! Signing this installation in and out.
//!
//! # The three flows, and why they are three
//!
//! ```text
//!   ENROLMENT  (this machine has no identity)   -> a client_id
//!   LOGIN      (this machine has a client_id)   -> a refresh token
//!   REFRESH    (this machine has both)          -> an access token
//! ```
//!
//! [`login`] runs the first two in order. They are genuinely different
//! operations: enrolment happens BEFORE any OAuth client exists, so the
//! request that opens it cannot be authenticated and what it yields is a
//! REGISTRATION; login is made by an authenticated `client_id` and what it
//! yields is a TOKEN. The identity leg happens in a BROWSER, on the server's
//! side of the wire, and no identity-provider artefact of any kind reaches
//! this process.
//!
//! # Why the loopback listener is bound first
//!
//! The redirect URI is registered during enrolment and is then fixed for the
//! life of the registration, so the port has to be known before the
//! registration is made. Binding port 0 first and registering the port the
//! kernel handed back is the only order in which the two agree.
//!
//! # Progress is reported, never printed
//!
//! Every step a person has to act on (open this page, enter this code) is
//! reported to the caller as a [`LoginEvent`], in order; the caller decides
//! how to show it. `wording::login_event_lines` is the terminal rendering.
