/// it is on, but a caller wanting every connection to a peer still has to
/// account for accepted ones separately. And `SyncStack::link_to` returns
/// a cached link without dialling when one is already alive, so a hook
/// installed after a link exists never sees it: a measurement must start
/// from a cold daemon, before any reconciliation or bulk link has been
/// opened, or it will silently be reusing an unwatched connection.
///
/// Called for *every* link this runtime dials, before its first lane
/// opens. Both halves matter: subscribing before the first lane is what
/// lets a [`PathWatcher`](yadorilink_sync_substrate::PathWatcher) cover a
/// transfer whole rather than from whenever it happened to start, and
/// seeing every link is what stops it from covering one connection's
