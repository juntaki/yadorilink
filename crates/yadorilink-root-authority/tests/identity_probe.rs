//! What this machine's filesystems can actually say about object identity.
//!
//! Whether a device can conclude "the file I am looking at is still the
//! file I recorded" is not a property of the code -- it is a property of
//! the volume. `FileIdentity::compare` asks, in order, for a generation
//! counter, then a symlink's own target digest, then a birth time it is
//! allowed to trust; a volume that offers none of those cannot answer,
//! and the honest result is `Ambiguous`.
//!
//! Diagnostic, not an assertion: it reports what a given directory's
//! filesystem supports rather than requiring any particular answer, since
//! the answer legitimately differs between ext4, tmpfs, overlayfs and a
//! network mount. Run it against a specific directory with
//! `YADORILINK_IDENTITY_PROBE_DIR=/some/path cargo test -p
//! yadorilink-root-authority --test identity_probe -- --ignored
//! --nocapture`.
