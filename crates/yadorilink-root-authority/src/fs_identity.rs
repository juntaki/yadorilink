//! Strong filesystem object identity.
//!
//! A single weak field — an inode number, a path, a modification time — can
//! be reused or forged by ordinary filesystem activity (delete-and-recreate,
//! a volume unmounted and a different one mounted at the same path, a
//! same-second overwrite). None of those fields alone can tell "the same
//! object I saw before" apart from "a different object that happens to share
//! one field with it". [`FileIdentity::compare`] is the one place that
//! judgment is made, and it returns a three-valued
//! [`IdentityComparison`] rather than a `bool` specifically so that
//! "cannot exclude reuse" cannot be silently collapsed into "same object" by
//! a careless `if identity_a == identity_b`.
//!
//! Everything here is *observation only*: reading identity from a path or an
//! open handle, and comparing two observations. Nothing in this module
//! decides what to do with an `Ambiguous` result — that policy belongs to
//! the caller that owns the recovery or replacement decision.

        // below `birth_or_creation_time`: it is content, not a clock
        // reading, so it needs no granularity gate, and it is the *only*

        // with (the ioctl that field comes from is never attempted for
        // this kind — see `generation_from_path`'s doc). 3.

        // delete-and- recreate landing in the same tick as the object it
        // replaced would report the exact same value, so equality alone
        // proves nothing there. 4. Neither present on both sides, or birth
        // time matched on a coarse clock — genuinely nothing here excludes
        // reuse, so the answer must be `Ambiguous`. `mtime` is
        // deliberately never used as a fallback here: an ordinary write
        // changes it, so it proves nothing about identity and would turn
        // "the same file, edited" into a false positive for "the same
