//! Sync-root identity: proving that the directory a scan is about to treat as
//! authoritative really is the folder this link was established against.
//!
//! The failure this exists to prevent: a sync root that lives on a removable or
//! network volume, unmounted. On every mainstream platform the mountpoint is an
//! ordinary directory that *survives* the unmount, so every existence check
//! (`Path::exists`, `fs::metadata`, even `canonicalize`) still succeeds and the
//! scanner walks a bare, empty directory. A full scan is authoritative by
//! design, so every indexed file then looks deleted and those deletions
//! propagate as tombstones to every other device. Unplugging a drive silently
//! destroys the folder everywhere. An existence check cannot see this, because
//! the thing that vanished is the *filesystem*, not the path.
//!
//! The guard is a marker file ([`ROOT_MARKER_FILE_NAME`]) written inside the
//! root, naming the group and an opaque per-link `root_token` that is also
//! persisted in the local `links` table. The marker rides on the same
//! filesystem as the content, so it disappears exactly when the content does: a
//! bare mountpoint has no marker, the token cannot be corroborated, and the
//! check fails closed.
//!
//! THE MARKER IS THE AUTHORITY — deliberately, in preference to a filesystem
//! identity such as `st_dev`. A device number is neither portable across
//! platforms nor stable across remounts: a USB volume routinely gets a
//! different `st_dev` on each plug, so an `st_dev` check would reject the very
//! folder it is meant to protect, on the ordinary happy path. It is recorded in
//! the marker as a human diagnostic for bug reports and is never compared —
//! see [`RootMarker::st_dev_hint`].
//!
//! `root_token` is an opaque identity nonce, never a digest of the folder's
//! contents or paths. It answers "is this the same folder I adopted?", a
//! question whose answer must stay `true` across every legitimate edit to that
//! folder — so binding it to content would make it self-invalidating. It is
//! orthogonal to exact-version binding (a change's content hash), which is the
//! construct for "are these the same bytes".
//!
//! # The `RootVerificationStatePort` split (Phase 7D-9B)
//!
//! Every constructor below needs two things from the durable index that this
//! crate itself cannot see: "does this group currently have more than one
//! live link" and "what root token, if any, did this device already persist
//! for this link" (plus, on the unmarked-adoption path, "does every live
//! indexed row still corroborate on disk"). [`RootVerificationStatePort`] is
//! the narrow, semantic port that answers exactly those questions —
//! deliberately not a generic CRUD surface, and deliberately not folded into
//! [`VerifiedRoot`] itself: `VerifiedRoot` stays a plain, private-field proof
//! value with no borrowed state and no trait-object indirection, per this
//! phase's own non-negotiable constraint (see its own doc below). The
//! production implementation, `impl RootVerificationStatePort for SyncState`,
//! stays in `yadorilink-sync-core` for now (moved here as a moved leaf
//! consumer, not a moved implementation) — `SyncState` itself doesn't leave
//! that crate until Phase 7D-9F.
