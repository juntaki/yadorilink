//! Probed, per-volume filesystem safety capabilities.
//!
//! Every capability here is established by *attempting the real operation*
//! against a caller-supplied directory and observing the actual syscall
//! result — never by reading a filesystem-type string and looking up what
//! that type is "supposed to" support. A network mount can present as
//! `ext4` over NFS re-export, a container bind-mount can silently strip a
//! primitive its host supports, and a removable drive can be reformatted
//! between two probes of the "same" path. Only the syscall result is ground
//! truth.
//!
//! # The cache is advisory, never authoritative
//!
//! [`CapabilityCache`] exists so that expensive repeated probing (creating
//! and exchanging real files, issuing real `ioctl`s) is not required on
//! every commit. It is keyed by [`CapabilityCacheKey`] — volume identity,
//! operation kind, adapter version and a mount-options fingerprint — never
//! by a single global "probed once at startup" flag, because that shape is
//! wrong on every removable and network volume: the volume behind a given
//! path can change without any code here observing it.
//!
//! Even so, **a cache hit must never be used to skip interpreting the real
//! result of an actual filesystem operation at the moment it happens.** The
//! cache may tell a caller which primitive is worth attempting first, or
//! back a status report; it must never stand in for checking what a commit
//! attempt's own return value says. Treating a cached `Supported` as a
//! license to assume success is exactly the bug this module exists to
//! prevent.
