//! Sync-root single-instance ownership: an OS-level advisory exclusive lock
//! proving no other process is concurrently treating this folder as a sync
//! root.
//!
//! Distinct from [`crate::root_identity`]: that module proves *this is the
//! right folder* (identity, corroborated against the index). This module
//! proves *nobody else is touching it right now* (mutual exclusion between
//! processes). The two are complementary, not overlapping — a folder can be
//! the right one and still be double-owned (two daemons pointed at the same
//! path), and holding this lock does nothing to prove which folder it is.
//!
//! # Why this is not held on `VerifiedRoot`
//!
//! `VerifiedRoot::open`/`verify` run on every scan, every materialization
//! repair pass, every peer-driven write — many times over one link's life,
//! inside a *single* daemon process. An OS `flock` conflicts between two
//! open file *descriptions* of the same file, even within one process, on
//! Linux and macOS (see the identical precedent already relied on by
//! `yadorilink-daemon::resource_lock::take_exclusive_lock`). Acquiring and
//! releasing a fresh lock on every `VerifiedRoot` construction would
//! therefore make two concurrent in-process operations on the *same* root
//! serialize-or-fail against each other — not what this guards against, and
//! it would break ordinary same-process concurrency today (concurrent scans
//! and repairs over one link are routine).
//!
//! The lock this module provides is instead acquired *once*, when the
//! daemon starts actively managing a link, and held for as long as the
//! daemon keeps that link active — mirroring the config-directory lock
//! (`yadorilink-daemon::app::DaemonInstanceLock`) and the data-resource locks
//! (`yadorilink-daemon::resource_lock::DataResourceLocks`), which are
//! likewise whole-process-lifetime locks rather than per-operation ones.
//!
//! # Mechanism
//!
//! A sidecar lock file at the top level of the root
//! ([`SYNC_ROOT_LOCK_FILE_NAME`], excluded from sync exactly like the
//! identity marker — see `local_change::is_excluded_from_sync`), held with a
//! non-blocking OS advisory exclusive lock (`flock`/`LockFileEx` via `fs2`)
//! for as long as the returned [`SyncRootLock`] is alive. The OS releases
//! the lock automatically when the holding process exits for any reason —
//! including `SIGKILL` and a hard crash — so the file left behind is never
//! read for "is this stale?"; a plain re-open-and-lock either succeeds
//! (nothing else holds it) or fails (something does), and that is the whole
//! answer.
//!
//! Deliberately, no PID is stored anywhere in this file, and none is read
//! back. A stored PID is not sufficient to tell "the process that held this
//! died" apart from "an unrelated process now has that PID" — PIDs are
//! reused, and a naive stale-lock reclaimer that trusts `kill(pid, 0)` can be
//! fooled by exactly that reuse into stepping on a live owner. What actually
//! answers "is the previous holder still alive" correctly is the *live OS
//! lock state itself*: the kernel tracks the lock against the open file
//! description, not a PID, and tears it down exactly when that description's
//! last reference (the process that opened it) goes away. That is a strictly
//! stronger and simpler signal than any PID bookkeeping this module could add
//! on top, so none is added.
//!
//! # What this assumes, and what happens when the assumption fails
//!
//! This mechanism assumes the underlying filesystem honours OS advisory
//! locking (`flock`/`fcntl`/`LockFileEx`) with real, exclusive,
//! cross-process semantics. Ordinary local filesystems on all three target
//! platforms (APFS, NTFS/ReFS, ext4/btrfs/xfs, ...) satisfy this.
//!
//! A sync root living on a network volume or removable media does not
//! necessarily satisfy it, and the failure mode is a silent fail-**open**,
//! not a refusal:
//!
//! * **NFS** delegates locking to `lockd`/NLM, and a mount using `nolock` (or
//!   talking to a server with no lock manager) grants every caller's lock
//!   request immediately regardless of who else holds it. There is no
//!   portable way to detect this from the client side in advance — the
//!   `try_lock_exclusive` call simply succeeds for two hosts at once.
//! * **SMB/CIFS**: whether an advisory lock taken by one client is honoured
//!   by the server against a *different* client mounting the same share
//!   depends on the server implementation and client mount options; some
//!   configurations only enforce it within one client's own processes.
//! * **Removable media (USB, exFAT/FAT32)** is single-host by construction,
//!   so cross-*process*-on-one-host exclusion still works normally (the
//!   local OS lock manager applies regardless of the filesystem format).
//!   What it cannot do is stop two *different* hosts each believing they own
//!   the volume after a silent unplug/replug from one of them — that
//!   scenario is `root_identity`'s job (the marker/token check), not this
//!   module's.
//!
//! In short: on local storage, and on one host's view of removable media,
//! this lock is correct and load-bearing. On genuinely shared network
//! storage it degrades to whatever that network filesystem's own
//! advisory-lock implementation actually provides, which this module has no
//! way to verify and does not attempt to — it fails closed on outright I/O
//! errors, but a lock request the server silently grants to two hosts at
//! once (the NFS `nolock` case above) is invisible to it by construction.
//! Design section 15's harder "genuine multi-process operation" case ("a
//! fenced lease checked immediately before every namespace mutation") is
//! what would be needed to close that gap; this module implements the
//! simpler single-owner refusal called for today, not that lease.
