//! The reserved on-disk artefact namespace.
//!
//! Filesystem-transaction artefacts (staged writes, captured preimages,
//! backups, retained-custody copies and filesystem-capability probe
//! artefacts) live *beside* the user object they belong to, under the same
//! parent directory, so their commit — or, for a probe, the operation it
//! measures — can share the same filesystem and volume as the object
//! itself. That only works if every path-consuming entry point in this
//! crate — the watcher, local change processing, the initial scan, DAG
//! import, peer admission and stale-file cleanup — agrees on exactly which
//! names are reserved, and agrees on it *before* user ignore rules run: a
//! user can configure `.yadorilinkignore` to un-ignore anything, but must
//! never be able to make an artefact name eligible for ordinary indexing.
//!
//! This module is that single shared predicate. It is a naming *protocol*,
//! not a convention a caller can opt out of: a path component that matches
//! is never content, regardless of what created it or what any ignore file
//! says.
//!
//! # Ownership rule
//!
//! Recognizing a name as reserved is not the same as owning it. A component
//! matching this predicate that no journal row (or, for the legacy marker,
//! no in-flight writer this process itself started) claims is an unknown
//! artefact: leftover from a crash, a different process, or a future
//! version this build doesn't understand. An unknown reserved-looking file
//! must never be deleted, imported, indexed or treated as user content —
//! see [`crate::error::SyncError::ReservedNamespaceCollision`] for the
//! fail-closed signal a caller raises when it finds one somewhere it did
//! not expect one.
//!
//! This module only recognizes names. It does not yet track which artefact
//! a given journal row owns — that arrives with the journal itself.
//!
//! # Two predicates, not one
//!
//! There are two different questions a caller can ask, and they must not be
//! collapsed into a single function:
//!
//! - **"Should this stay out of ordinary sync?"** — [`is_reserved_component`]
//!   / [`path_has_reserved_component`]. True for both a versioned artefact
//!   and the legacy marker. Used by the watcher, the initial scan, local
//!   change processing and DAG import: every place that decides what to
//!   index or track. `fs_capabilities`'s probe artefacts rely on exactly
//!   this predicate to stay invisible to those entry points for the brief
//!   window between their creation and their own removal — see
//!   [`ArtefactKind::Probe`].
//! - **"May a peer or a local writer *name* this path at all?"** —
//!   [`is_artefact_component`] / [`path_has_artefact_component`]. True only
//!   for a versioned artefact, never for the legacy marker. Used by DAG
//!   admission and peer materialization: every place that fails a whole
//!   operation closed.
//!
//! The legacy marker is exclusion-only by design (see
//! [`ReservedComponent::Legacy`]): `contains_legacy_marker` is a substring
//! test within a component, deliberately looser than the versioned kinds'
//! whole-component match, because arbitrary user content can precede it
//! (`report.yadorilink-tmp.old`) — `materialization::cleanup_stale_temp_
//! files` already refuses to delete exactly such a look-alike. Two things
//! follow from that looseness, and both are why the legacy marker must
//! never reach a rejection site:
//!
//! - A change or a peer write naming a legacy-marked path is not
//!   necessarily an artefact at all — it can be an ordinary user file that
//!   merely contains the substring, and rejecting it would make a real file
//!   permanently un-syncable, in direct conflict with the GC's own
//!   preservation of that same file.
//! - History predating this module can already contain a legacy-marked
//!   path, admitted back when nothing excluded it (that gap is exactly the
//!   latent bug this module closes at the exclusion sites). If admission
//!   used the exclusion predicate, an upgraded peer would refuse that
//!   already-signed change forever — turning a client-side fix into a
//!   group-wide sync stall.
//!
//! So exclusion is deliberately over-inclusive (better to skip indexing a
//! look-alike than risk treating a real artefact as content), while
//! rejection is deliberately narrow (only a name this module itself can
//! construct is grounds for refusing an entire operation).

///
/// **Aliasing** — two distinct peer-authored paths land on ONE Windows
/// on-disk object, so admitting both as independent index rows lets
/// whichever materializes second silently overwrite the other with no
/// conflict ever detected (see [`path_has_non_portable_wire_component`]'s
/// doc comment for the full mechanism):
/// - A literal `:` anywhere in the component. Windows parses `:` as the
///   alternate-data-stream separator (`filename:stream`), addressing a
///   stream *on* `filename` — not a distinct file. Two independent-looking
///   peer-authored paths `"notes"` and `"notes:draft"` are both ordinary,
///   independent files on Linux/macOS (where `:` is just a character), but
///   a Windows materializer resolves the second one onto the first one's
///   own data stream. (A drive-qualified first segment such as `"C:"` or
///   `"C:foo"` is already rejected earlier, by `change::validate_path`;
///   this check is broader — it also catches a `:` anywhere inside a
///   component, not only that one position-specific shape.)
/// - Trailing `.`/` ` stripping (see
///   [`strip_windows_trailing_normalization`]): a component that is not
///   byte-identical to its own stripped form is not portable — a Windows
///   materializer stores it under a *different* name than the one on the
///   wire, which is how e.g. `"a"` and `"a "` collide.
/// - [`has_short_name_alias_shape`]: on an NTFS volume with 8.3 short-name
///   generation enabled (still the default on the Windows system volume),
///   materializing a long filename also creates an automatically generated
///   short alias for it, and a *separate* peer-authored path equal to that
///   alias then resolves to the same on-disk object as the long name — two
///   independent-looking index rows collide into one file the moment the
///   long name materializes on Windows, exactly the same harm as the
///   trailing-dot/space case, just triggered by a second, unrelated path
///   rather than a suffix on the same one. Unlike every other check here,
///   the actual generated alias is not something this predicate can
///   compute: the algorithm depends on the numeric-tail collision count
///   already present in the target directory (state a peer proposing a
///   change cannot observe) and on whether 8.3 generation is even enabled
///   on the eventual target volume (a per-volume, changeable setting, not
///   a property of the path). Neither is available, or stable, at
///   admission time, and a check that could disagree with itself across
///   peers or across time would violate this module's basic contract that
///   every peer reach the identical verdict for the identical wire path.
///   So instead of computing the alias, this refuses any component with
///   the *shape* an alias always has (`NAME~N` or `NAME~N.EXT`, at most 8
///   characters before the extension): no long name can ever coincide with
///   an authored path in that shape, so no alias of it can either. The
///   cost is real and accepted deliberately: a POSIX file genuinely named
///   e.g. `REPORT~1.TXT` is not exotic, and this makes it permanently
///   unsyncable for the whole group, forever, even for a group with no
///   Windows member and no 8.3 generation anywhere in it. That is the same
///   trade this module already makes for a reserved device name or a
///   trailing dot — refuse a look-alike rather than risk the silent
///   collision — applied to a shape that is admittedly far more likely to
///   occur in real, intentional filenames than `CON` or a trailing space
///   is.
///
/// **Permanent platform split, no aliasing** — Windows does not
/// silently rename these, it refuses to create them at all,
/// deterministically, every time. There is no on-disk collision to cause,
/// but admitting the path still splits the group along platform lines
/// exactly as [`wire_path_components`]'s own doc comment reasons about for
/// a drive-qualified path: a change every non-Windows member accepts and
/// materializes forever is one every Windows member can never materialize,
/// forever — and (separately) the index row it leaves behind on that
/// Windows device can never match a disk entry, the identical
/// index/disk-divergence shape as the aliasing cases, just triggered by an
/// outright creation failure instead of a silent rename:
/// - [`is_windows_reserved_device_name`]: the component names a reserved
///   Windows device, including the Unicode superscript-digit spellings of
///   `COM1`-`COM3`/`LPT1`-`LPT3` (see
///   [`WINDOWS_RESERVED_DEVICE_NAME_SUPERSCRIPTS`]) as well as the ASCII
///   ones.
/// - [`WINDOWS_RESERVED_FILENAME_CHARS`]: the component contains a
///   character Win32 refuses in a filename outright.
/// - [`contains_ascii_control_character`]: the component contains an ASCII
///   control character (`U+0001`-`U+001F`), which Win32 also refuses
///   outright in a filename.
///
/// General portability predicate, not specific to the reserved-artefact
/// namespace the rest of this module owns: it applies to *any*
/// peer-authored path, not only look-alikes of a reserved name. The
/// artefact predicate ([`is_artefact_wire_component`]) only asks "does
/// this look like one of our own reserved names"; this one asks "can this
/// path be faithfully, unambiguously stored on every member's platform at
/// all."
///
/// Deliberately does NOT reject: a case-only collision (`"Notes.txt"` vs
/// `"notes.txt"`, which collide on Windows/macOS's default case-insensitive
/// filesystems but not on Linux) — a real, but different-shaped hazard
/// this codebase already has dedicated machinery for (see `hazard.rs`'s
/// and `peer_session.rs`'s case-fold-sibling handling), not a "refuse the
/// path outright" fix. Nor a path-length limit (historic Windows `MAX_PATH`
/// is opt-in-extendable per-device today, so unlike every check above it
/// does not fail identically on every Windows install — rejecting for it
/// here would sacrifice a file for a group whose Windows members may all
/// have long-path support enabled). Nor a leading or interior space/dot,
