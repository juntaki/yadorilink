//! The networking substrate node: `YadoriSyncProtocol` registered as its own
//! ALPN on an iroh endpoint.
//!
//! Why iroh directly, and not `p2panda-net` / `p2panda-sync`:
//!
//! * `p2panda_sync::traits::Protocol::run` runs over a *single* sink/stream
//!   pair. Yadori requires three independent flow-control domains, which a
//!   single lane cannot express.
//! * `p2panda-net` 0.7 does not expose a way to host a custom
//!   `p2panda_sync::Manager` anyway. Its generic `sync::actors::SyncManager<M>`
//!   is private; the only public entry is `LogSync`, hardcoded to
//!   `TopicSyncManager` and the append-only-log store traits.
//! * What remained of `p2panda-net`'s value (address book, discovery, gossip)
//!   is reachable only through its mandatory `address_book` feature, which
//!   pulls `sqlx` and therefore `libsqlite3-sys 0.30`. That collides on the
//!   `links = "sqlite3"` native library with the `rusqlite` stack the replica
//!   store is built on, and no version selection resolves it.
//!
//! So the substrate is iroh: QUIC, NAT traversal, relay, address lookup, and
//! `Router`-dispatched ALPN handlers.
