//! Who is allowed to open a sync lane with this device.
//!
//! The TLS handshake proves the remote holds the private key for the
//! [`PeerId`] it claims. That is authentication, and it is all iroh can
//! offer: it says the peer is who it says it is, and nothing at all about
//! whether this device has any business talking to them. Without a second
//! check, any stranger who learns an address gets a live lane, because
//! "I am a valid Ed25519 keyholder" is a statement every keyholder on
//! earth can make truthfully.
//!
//! So admission asks the only question authentication leaves open: is this
//! authenticated identity one of *our* devices? A remote is admitted when
//! its [`PeerId`] resolves to a device this node has pinned through the
//! coordination plane, and refused otherwise.
//!
//! # Why this is a required argument and not an `Option`
//!
//! [`SubstrateNode::spawn`](crate::SubstrateNode::spawn) takes a policy by
//! value with no default. That is deliberate and is the whole of the
//! fail-closed guarantee: there is no way to spawn a node without stating
//! who it will talk to, so admission cannot be lost by forgetting to
//! configure it. A `None`-means-allow-everything default would put the
//! secure behaviour behind an opt-in, and the one call site that forgets
//! is then indistinguishable from one that deliberately opened up.
//!
//! # What this is *not*
//!
//! Admission decides whether a carrier-level link exists. It says nothing
//! about what may be done over that link: whether a peer may read a folder
//! group, or whether a Change it offers may be admitted to history, stays
//! with the replica and policy layers, which verify authorship against a
//! group's own policy chain and never consult the carrier. An admitted
//! peer is a peer we will exchange bytes with, not a peer we trust.
