//! The relay harness itself.
//!
//! Everything the relay track asserts later rests on one claim: that a node
//! configured relay-only really is relayed, for the whole life of the
//! connection, without touching public infrastructure. If that claim is
//! wrong — if a direct path quietly appears partway through — then every
//! "over the relay" result above it is measuring something else.
//!
//! So this file gates the harness, not the protocol.
