"""Fail when a content-materialization write bypasses a crash-safe journal seam.

A file's blocks reach disk through exactly one low-level primitive,
`chunker::reconstruct_file`. Startup/periodic repair
(`materialization::repair_interrupted_materializations`) has to tell a
crash-mid-materialize (a `Hydrated` row whose file is missing but whose blocks
are present -> RECONSTRUCT) from an offline user-delete (same state ->
tombstone). That disambiguation only works if EVERY path that commits a
`Hydrated` content row with a still-pending disk write first records a durable
signal it can read back after a crash. Three such disciplines exist:

  * the materialization-intent journal (`MaterializationIntentGuard` in
    daemon `materialization_intent.rs`): write a durable intent BEFORE the bytes, clear it
    only AFTER the rename. Used by repair's own reconstruct and by the live peer
    materialize path.
  * the `Placeholder`/`Hydrating` -> `Hydrated` atomic flip: the row is only
    flipped to `Hydrated` AFTER the rename, so a crash leaves a non-`Hydrated`
    row that repair's pre-filter skips. Used by the hydrate paths.
  * the durable `restore_operations` journal: the intended version is recorded
    before the atomic replacement and reconciled against disk on restart. Used
    by the restore path.

This guard makes the class un-reintroducible in two ways:

1. The materialization-intent WRITE primitives
   (`begin_materialization_intent`, `clear_materialization_intent`) may be
   called only from the guard, startup repair, or an identically named method
   on a narrow materialization port adapter.
   A new path may not hand-roll intent bookkeeping — it must go through the
   guard. (The `has_materialization_intent` READ is unrestricted: repair, the
   live invariant `debug_assert`, and tests all consult it.)

2. Every production `reconstruct_file(` call site (or call of the daemon's
   off-runtime forwarder to it) must live in one of the sanctioned seam files
   above, and the total number of such call sites is pinned. A new content write anywhere — even an extra one inside an
   already-sanctioned file — trips the guard for review, forcing the author to
   confirm it is bracketed by one of the three disciplines.
