# Proves, by compiling it, that a product caller cannot assemble an
# authenticated Coordination credential except through the canonical lifecycle.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE CRATE AND NOT A `#[test]`
#
# The property is "this does not compile", and the only honest way to check it
# is to try to compile it. That cannot be done from inside the workspace, for
# two reasons that are not stylistic:
#
#   * an integration test under `crates/yadorilink-fapi-client/tests/` is an
#     external crate, but its target enables that crate's `test-support`
#     feature -- so it sees `test_support::manager_over`, which a product caller
#     does not. A probe compiled there would be testing the wrong visibility;
#   * `yadorilink-cli` and `yadorilink-daemon` also enable `test-support`, in
#     their `[dev-dependencies]`, and cargo unifies features per build. Every
#     test target in this workspace therefore sees more of the crate than the
#     shipped binaries do.
#
# So the probe is generated OUTSIDE the workspace, in a scratch directory, as a
# crate whose `[dependencies]` name `yadorilink-fapi-client` with default
# features -- the same way `yadorilink-cli` names it in the dependency table
# that actually ships.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS
#
# Not merely "the build failed": a probe with a typo in it also fails. Each
# attempt below is expected to be refused for a NAMED reason, and the script
# requires every one of those reasons to appear in the compiler's output. A
# refusal that changes character -- say, `seed` becoming public again while some
# unrelated line still fails to compile -- is a failure here.
#
# Run from anywhere; it operates on this repository.
