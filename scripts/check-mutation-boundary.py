"""Fail when production code bypasses the change-emitting index-mutation seam.

Every LOCAL current-row mutation must append its signed change to the history
DAG in the same transaction — the job of the `*_emitting_change` family in
`index.rs`. This guard forbids the raw, non-emitting current-row writers
(`upsert_file`, `upsert_files_batch`, `set_exec_bit`, `set_record_kind`,
`mark_deleted_at`) from being called in production local-capture, peer-session,
or daemon code outside the SQLite repository and its narrow port adapters, so
a new DAG-silent local write cannot quietly reappear.

Allowed unconditionally:
  - the `*_emitting_change` family (an emitting local write), and
  - `upsert_file_with_origin` (applying a peer's already-signed change,
    correctly index-only / DAG-silent — the Projected seam).
Both are excluded by construction: the forbidden tokens require a `(`
immediately after the bare name, so `upsert_file_emitting_change(`,
`upsert_files_batch_emitting_change(`, and `upsert_file_with_origin(` never
match.

A small allowlist pins the handful of known-legit raw calls that remain:
index-only Projected metadata application in peer-session, and the two
sanctioned non-emitting local-capture paths (a group whose change
DAG has not been seeded yet, and the standalone no-emitter build). The total
allowed-hit count is pinned so a new raw call — even one that happens to share
an allowlisted snippet — trips the guard for review.
