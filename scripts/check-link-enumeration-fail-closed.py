"""Ban silently collapsing a link-table read into "there are no links".

`list_links()` is fallible. Turning that error into an empty list with
`.unwrap_or_default()` does not mean "no links"; it means "I could not tell".
The two are not interchangeable, and the daemon acts on the difference:

  * The startup path uses the link list to run crash-recovery repair and to
    start each folder's watcher, which is what arms that group's startup gate.
    An empty list skips both, silently, for every folder.
  * The peer path resolves its sync roots from the same table, independently.
    It does not observe the startup path's failure.

So a swallowed enumeration error does not stop syncing -- it removes the
scan and the gate while leaving the writes. An inbound peer change then lands
in a folder that was never scanned this boot and overwrites local bytes that
were never indexed, with no conflict copy, because the local content never
became a change the DAG could see. Silent, and the user's own data.

The same shape is fine on a read-only diagnostic path, where "no links" merely
produces an unhelpful answer. What is never fine is doing it *silently*: this
guard requires the error to be surfaced, so the collapse is a visible decision
at the call site rather than a default that reads as routine.

ALLOWED (explicit, error surfaced):
    let links = state.sync_state.list_links().unwrap_or_else(|e| {
        tracing::warn!(error = %e, "cannot read link table; ...");
        Vec::new()
    });

ALLOWED (fail-closed, preferred on any path that writes or gates):
    let links = sync_state.list_links()?;

BANNED:
    for link in sync_state.list_links().unwrap_or_default() { ... }
    let links = state.sync_state.list_links().unwrap_or(vec![]);
    let links = state.sync_state.list_links().ok().unwrap_or_default();

Run with --self-test to prove the guard still detects the shape it bans.
