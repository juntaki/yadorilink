# Residual-symbol guard for the simplified peer-to-peer product surface.
#
# Several advanced features were removed to keep the product to a small set of
# concepts (account, device, synced folder, and two storage modes) — folders
# sync across a single account's own devices only. This script fails if any of
# those removed features' active-use symbols reappear in shippable code,
# protocol definitions, the CLI, the desktop app, or non-archived docs.
#
# Pre-release policy: migration history is not itself a compatibility boundary.
# Removed development-only tables/columns should be folded out of the canonical
# fresh schema, not kept alive by requiring historical migration files that add
# a column and later drop it again. Therefore this guard checks active product
# symbols only; it does not require old removal migrations to remain present.
#
# What counts as a violation is *active use* (a type, function, field, or column
# that only exists when the feature is present). Legitimate documentation of a
# removal is intentionally NOT a violation and is filtered out:
#   - protobuf `reserved` field-number/name declarations (they prevent reuse),
#   - SQL `DROP` statements in any still-relevant migration,
#   - the dedicated removal-guard test that lists forbidden symbols as data.
#
# Excluded from the scan: the VCS/build/dependency trees, lock files, the
# archived internal planning-document history, and this script's own term
# list -- planning documents necessarily name the features they describe
# removing, so referencing a removed feature there is not itself a
# violation.
#
# Usage: check_removed_features.sh [--self-test]
#   --self-test  check the checker against throwaway fixture trees instead of
#                scanning the repository.

# generic enough that a kept feature, or prose recording the removal, uses the
# same words. Only the removed implementation's own identifiers are listed, and
# only code is scanned (plus the coordination worker's tests), so the word
# alone is never a violation:
#   - The operator-run relay was removed: its server, hub, client, auth and
#     I/O modules, its wire messages and its `yadorilink-relay` binary. The
#     transport's own relay path (NAT-traversal fallback, e.g.
#     `PathKind::Relay`) is a kept feature and is deliberately not listed.
#   - The self-hosted gRPC coordination server and its `http-coordination`
#     Cargo feature were removed.
#   - The read/write share-role axis was removed: the policy role, the
#     per-group role map in the network map (camelCase on the wire), and the
#     sync core's gate that rejected writes from read-role peers. The
#     Owner/Editor/Viewer sharing roles (`ShareRole`) are a separate, kept
#     feature and are deliberately not listed.
#   - The legacy wire re-bootstrap protocol was removed: the service-lane
#     request/response that shipped a signed `RebootstrapRequired`, the
#     client request and responder, the handler port, and the SQLite install
#     that kept frontier bodies and installed the base's witnesses without
#     verifying them. A base now arrives only through the verified foreign
#     merge (`verify_foreign_base` -> `commit_foreign_merge`), installed by
#     the same atomic epoch reset a seal commits.
