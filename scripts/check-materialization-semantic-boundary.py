"""Pin every production call to a raw materialization-semantic API.

"Materialization semantics" is the family of durable facts that decide
whether a path's local bytes are trusted: the materialization intent
journal, the per-path mutation fence, `files.materialization_state` and the
held marker, placeholder identities, published materialized generations
(proofs), projection-obligation completion, the restore journal, the
local-capture adoption that writes the same facts from the other side, and
the structural-directory origin ledger (which directories this device made
only for descendants, and whose intent moves the fence).
Today several callers compose these primitives directly, each in its own
order and transaction granularity, which is how protocols drift apart (an
intent opened by one delete lane and not by the other, a revert guard that
downgrades in one hydration lane and not in the other).

Those compositions belong behind owner-side semantic operations: inherent
methods on `ReplicaCoordinator` (`crates/yadorilink-daemon/src/
replica_coordinator/`) that run one protocol, or one half of it around a
physical write, in a fixed order. This guard freezes the shape: a raw call
to any API in `FORBIDDEN` may appear only in a production file listed in
`ALLOWLIST`, only for an API listed under that file, and only as many times
as pinned there. The grand total is pinned again in `EXPECTED_ALLOWED`, so
every added, moved or removed call site is reviewed and recorded here rather
than slipping in. A change that closes a composition behind an owner
operation lowers the counts and updates them in the same commit.

Each allowlisted file is one of three kinds (`file_kind`): the owner
(`replica_coordinator/`), the SQLite repository (`yadorilink-sync-sqlite`),
or an orchestration lane (everything else: convergence, hydration, repair,
eviction, capture). Orchestration lanes may not ADD raw calls. The lane
files that still hold some are frozen in `LANE_FILES`; a lane file missing
from it fails, and so does a stale entry. Every pin, lane or not, is exact:
the check fails on any difference, in either direction, and there is no
recorded baseline to compare against. So nothing here mechanically stops a
lane's pin, or `LANE_FILES`, from growing; what the check guarantees is that
growing one takes an edit to this script, which review sees. The policy that
review enforces: a new lane, or a new step in an existing one, calls a
`ReplicaCoordinator` semantic operation (adding one there if needed) instead
of composing the primitives itself, so lane pins and `LANE_FILES` only
shrink, and counts go up only inside `replica_coordinator/` or the
repository.

A second section, `IN_FAMILY`, pins the same way the in-family row mutators
that also write non-materialization facts (peer row application, authoring
advance, local-only erase, pin, block provenance). They are not forbidden
outright because unrelated writers share them, but every production call
site is pinned in `IN_FAMILY_ALLOWLIST`, under the same lane rule.

How a hit is found (a textual scan, not a Rust parser):
  * `name(` with no identifier character immediately before `name`, so
    `dag_bump_mutation_fence(` never counts as `bump_mutation_fence(`, and
    `clear_held_in_tx(` never counts as `clear_held(`. A turbofish
    (`name::<T>(`) still counts.
  * The definition itself (`fn name(`), including a trait declaration, is
    not a call and is not counted.
  * Trailing `//` comments and whole-line comments are dropped first.
  * Test code is excluded: any item under a `cfg` that holds only in test
    builds (`#[cfg(test)]`, `#[cfg(all(test, unix))]`,
    `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]`; the recognized gates are
    `test` and `feature = "test-support"`, so `any(test, madsim)` or any
    other gate stays production), a module file declared
    under such a `cfg` in its parent (followed through `#[path]` and nested
    module directories), a file that opens with `#![cfg(test)]`, and
    everything outside `crates/*/src` (integration tests, benches).

Known blind spots, recorded rather than hidden: an `OpenMaterializationIntent`
guard's `.clear()` and its uncleared drop cannot be told apart from any other
`.clear()`/drop by text, so the guard instead pins every way to OBTAIN one
(`open_materialization_intent_guard(`, `MaterializationIntentGuard::open(`);
and a primitive passed as a function value without a call (`.map(name)`) is
not seen. Reviewer judgment remains the backstop.

Run with no arguments to check the tree, `--list` to print every counted
call site of `FORBIDDEN` (file:line, enclosing fn, API), `--list-in-family`
for the `IN_FAMILY` sites, and `--self-test` to exercise the scanner against
synthetic fixtures.
