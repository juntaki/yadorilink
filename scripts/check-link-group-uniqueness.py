"""Keep the `links` table's one-live-link-per-group invariant enforceable.

A folder group may be linked to at most ONE folder on a device. The reason is
not tidiness. The file index is group-scoped and path-relative, but every disk
scan is root-scoped and authoritative. With two live roots on one group, each
root's scan walks its own folder, finds the OTHER root's indexed paths absent,
and tombstones them -- signed changes that ride the change-DAG to every device.
The user loses their own files, everywhere, silently, having done nothing but
link a folder twice.

This guard protects the two structural properties that keep that unreachable:

  1. `INSERT INTO links` appears exactly ONCE, inside `insert_link_row`. That
     function is the write chokepoint: it holds the check and the insert in one
     `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, so two concurrent `link` calls cannot both
     pass. A second insert site anywhere else is a bypass, and it would be a
     bypass that compiles, passes review, and loses data only in the field.

  2. `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO links` appears ZERO times. It is not a safer
     upsert here; it is three silent harms at once, each measured:
       * against a UNIQUE index it does not error, it DELETES the conflicting
         row -- silent link loss,
       * it resets `root_token` to NULL, re-arming root adoption and thereby
         disarming the unmounted-volume guard that stops whole-folder
         tombstoning,
       * it flips `orphaned` 1 -> 0, an un-orphan path nothing in the code
         intends and which resurrects a link whose authorization is gone.

  3. Both schema triggers are still present in `index.rs`. They are the layer
     that survives a writer which never reads the Rust chokepoint -- a raw
     `sqlite3` session, a second process, or a future third insert site.

Run with --self-test to prove the guard still detects the shapes it bans.
