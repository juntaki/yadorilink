"""Fail when production sync code physically deletes blocks outside the gate.

Physical block deletion has exactly two owners, and both take a
`&BlockPhysicalDeletionGuard` -- the exclusive side of `BlockLivenessGate`,
which proves no reference write (a materialization or hydration that could
still need the block) is in flight:

  * `sweep_globally_unreferenced_blocks` (filesystem-sync `block_deletion.rs`)
    for the grace-period sweep of blocks no row references; and
  * `ReplicaCoordinator::reclaim_cached_blocks` (daemon
    `replica_coordinator/block_reclamation.rs`) for custody-verified eviction,
    which also re-checks the custody's exact version, the pin and
    materialization state, the custody confirmation and the cross-row
    reference set under that guard before freeing anything.

Everything else must reach deletion through one of them. This guard fails on
a `.sweep(` or `.reclaim_cached_blocks(` call anywhere else unless the call
passes a deletion guard as its first argument (i.e. it is a call INTO one of
the gated owners, not a call on the raw `BlockReclamationStore`), and on a
direct `.delete(` in a file that handles a block store.
